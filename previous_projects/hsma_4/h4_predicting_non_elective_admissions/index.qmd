The project aim was to develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of admission and to provide explanatory feedback as to why the patients were at risk. There were three elements of the project:

1. Using structured data to generate a predictive model

2. Use unstructured data from patient notes to generate a predictive model

3. To combine the two models to create an enhanced model

Three models were developed using structured data â€“ logistic regression, random forest and neural network. Logistic regression performed best.

For the unstructured data, attempts to use more advanced Natural Language Processing techniques (such as neural networks and transformers) were unsuccessful due to limited computing power. However, a more basic model using a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency matrix with a random forest showed some improvement on accuracy.

Electronic health record data can accurately be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of non-elective admission. Administrative events are often better indicators than clinical measures, however EHR data is prone to several limitations and biases which can lead to counter-intuitive correlations. For analysis of unstructured data, greater computing power than I have access to is required to analyse the large quantities of patient notes, even when focusing on relatively short time frames.

It will make a difference to patient care by allowing patients at risk of non-elective admission to receive preventative care, leading to better health outcomes for the individual patients and freeing up inpatient resources for other patients.
