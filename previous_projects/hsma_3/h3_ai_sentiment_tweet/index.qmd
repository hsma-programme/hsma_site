This project used AI-based Natural Language Processing methods to develop a dashboard that predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of every tweet to every police force in the country, and automatically identifies the topics that people are talking about positively or negatively. The project has transformed the way in which Avon and Somerset Constabulary’s social media team can respond to concerns identified by members of the public. The HSMA who led this project is now mentoring a project in the fourth round of the programme, to help spread the skills and knowledge he acquired during the programme.
