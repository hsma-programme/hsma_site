This project will aim to model the pathway for Neurosurgical patients, and to explore, based on current waiting times, will the waiting list grow or reduce, and how long will patients wait for treatment.

The aim is to add user interaction, to see how an increase/reduction in capacity affects waiting times. Also to be able to see how many patients are waiting over 52 weeks at each month end.
