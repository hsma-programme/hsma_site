    The project models the neurosurgical patient pathway to predict waiting list changes and treatment wait times. It aims to add user interaction to explore how capacity adjustments affect waiting times and track patients waiting over 52 weeks each month.

This project will aim to model the pathway for Neurosurgical patients, and to explore, based on current waiting times,

- will the waiting list grow or reduce
- how long patients may wait for treatment

The aim is to add user interaction, to see how an increase/reduction in capacity affects waiting times. Also to be able to see how many patients are waiting over 52 weeks at each month end.
