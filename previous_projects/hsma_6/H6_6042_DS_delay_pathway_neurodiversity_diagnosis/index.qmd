Currently, across multiple healthcare providers in Devon, around 6,000 children have been waiting more than 52 weeks for a neurodiversity diagnosis.  These diagnoses can unlock a number of measures otherwise unavailable to the children to help support their education and independence.

The project will aim to reduce the current waiting list, as well as introduce analytic tools that aim to streamline the current process and keep referral times low.

Approaches used will include:

- DES modelling of current pathway, adjustable where resources may be applied
- NLP to sort applications and referrals, combined with machine learning algorithm generation to automatically suggest pathway options
- Geographic modelling to identify inequalities related to location
