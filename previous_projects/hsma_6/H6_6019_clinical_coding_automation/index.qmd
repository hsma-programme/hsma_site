The aim of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict ICD-10 or OPCS-4 codes from doctor/patient notes, automating a task currently done manually by the clinical coding team.

Initially, we'll predict 3-character ICD-10 chapters, with the goal of eventually predicting full 4-character codes. Collaborating with a provider that has access to these notes, this project will streamline coding and improve accuracy.
