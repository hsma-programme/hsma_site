    A GP practice had peak call wait times of 60 minutes. Adding more staff improved this, but lower utilisation was then seen during quieter periods. This project will model the telephone system and call handlers' workload to optimise resourcing, producing a web app to test different scenarios.

A GP practice serving 35,000 patients experiences peak call wait times of 60 minutes. While increasing staffing levels has reduced these wait times, this approach can result in periods of lower utilization during quieter times.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive model of the telephone system and call handler workload patterns. The goal is to create an analytical tool that can evaluate telephone resource allocation and identify opportunities for operational optimization.

A web-based application will be developed to enable testing of various staffing scenarios and resource allocation strategies.
