The GP practice of 35000 patients has a call wait time of 60 mins peak.  This has been improved by simply putting more staff on, but there are lots of staff in the lulls, not doing anything.

This project will build a model of the telephone system and call handlers' work load to build a tool to assess telephone resourcing and find potential ways to improve efficiency. 

A web app will be developed to allow for different scenarios to be tested.
