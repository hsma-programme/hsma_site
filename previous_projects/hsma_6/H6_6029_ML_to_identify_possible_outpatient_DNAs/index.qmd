This project will use Machine Learning approaches to identify possible outpatient DNAs

The project aims to train a machine learning model to identify patients with upcoming appointments who are most likely to DNA (did not attend), to prioritise additional support from outpatient booking team, e.g.

- Extra text reminders
- Phone call with opportunity to rebook
- Phone call to ask if patient requires public transport information, travel plan, or support to get to appointment

As a possible extra, the project may use discrete event simulation (DES) to demonstrate impact on clinic utilisation and waiting times if DNA rates are reduced
