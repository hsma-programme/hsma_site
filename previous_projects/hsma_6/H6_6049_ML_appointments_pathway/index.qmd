The new EPP data set combines data to create the most complete version of elective pathway activity we have ever had.  At the moment we donâ€™t know why some people/pathways have more appointments than others, but one theory is that long waiting times result in sicker patients which results in more total appointments.

This project plans to use Machine Learning methods to try to unpick this.
