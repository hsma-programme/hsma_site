    The new EPP data set offers the most comprehensive view of elective pathway activity. Currently, the reasons for varying appointment numbers are unclear, but one theory is that longer waits lead to sicker patients and more appointments. This project plans to use Machine Learning to investigate this further.

The new EPP data set combines data to create the most complete version of elective pathway activity we have ever had.  At the moment we donâ€™t know why some people/pathways have more appointments than others, but one theory is that long waiting times result in sicker patients which results in more total appointments.

This project plans to use Machine Learning methods to try to unpick this.
