Making Every Contact Count (MECC) is an e-learning programme in which health and social care staff are encouraged to use various interactions with patients to open conversations about healthy lifestyles and wellbeing.

The aim of this project is to use Agent Based Simulation to model the behavioural dynamics and success rates on lifestyle factors (such as smoking, drinking, exercise) of MECC interventions, and thereby try to understand the potential impact of MECC training.
