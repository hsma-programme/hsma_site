    The project aims to forecast the regional demand for medical doctors, considering factors like trainees and population. It will plot a graph showing the current supply versus demand. Additionally, it will simulate outcomes under different scenarios, such as changes in trainee numbers or population health, to better understand and address the gap.

The problem: Not enough medical doctors by region and we need to establish the gap between what we have and what we need.

The Aim: Forecast medical doctors required by region, taking into account relevant factors for example, trainees coming in, population etc.

The Output: To plot a graph to show our current supply and what we demand.

Bonus would be to be able to simulate outcome of demand, if input is amended to reflect different scenarios i.e. number of trainees decreases or population ill health increases etc
