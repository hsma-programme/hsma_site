    The project uses machine learning to estimate future frailty in the Wakefield District and identify key predictive features. It aims to plan resource allocation based on evidence, using two years of linked data. The project will also explore predicting other long-term conditions and produce reports and a user interface for stakeholders.

This project will use machine learning methods to estimate the size of the Wakefield District population who will likely be frail in 2 / 3 / 4 years time, and to understand the key features used to predict whether a person will become frail in the near future at a local level.

Planning for future population health needs

- The ability to plan and design resource allocation (e.g. beds available) in an evidence-based manner is a crucial and consistent priority within the ICB
- There is soon to be approximately 2 yearsâ€™ worth of linked data, allowing us to begin building and evaluating the use of ML-based techniques aiming to predict the future prevalence of various LTCs or conditions
- Pending the outcomes of this project, we anticipate there to be future scope to adapt similar approached and apply learning to predicting the future prevalence of other LTCs such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD conditions, respiratory conditions and so forth

The project will produce reports from the work and potentially a dashboard or other user interface.
