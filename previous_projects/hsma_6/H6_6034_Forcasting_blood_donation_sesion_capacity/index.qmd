Blood donation sessions have limits of how many people will be able to attend a session.  Bookings for sessions often donâ€™t convert into actual donations due to cancellations, non-attendance and medical rejections.  These missed collections represent a lost opportunity to successfully bring someone in to donate.

The aim of this project is to:

1.	Develop a Machine Learning-based predictive tool to assess, of the current bookings made for a session, what proportion of these are likely to take place, and if there is room for additional capacity
2.	Build a web based app that demonstrates the above and allows users to review current available capacity at each session
