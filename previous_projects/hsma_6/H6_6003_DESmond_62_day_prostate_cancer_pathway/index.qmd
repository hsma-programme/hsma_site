    This project aims to develop a Discrete Event Simulation model to predict demand and identify potential bottlenecks using live data. This model could help reallocate resources proactively, helping to ensure people have the fastest possible treatment.

Prostate cancer pathways involves numerous activities such as triaging, imaging, biopsies as well as multiple decisions along the way. The smooth running of the pathway relies upon having the necessary resources allocated each of these events e.g. biopsy clinics, access to imaging etc.

We want to develop a system which can anticipate the demand for resources, dependant on the number of referrals and resources allocated.

The aim is

- to create a Discrete Event Simulation model to model the current pathway
- to feed live data into the model in order to predict where bottlenecks might occur
- make use of forecasting methods to predicts what changes are needed in resource allocation

The project outcome will be a simulation model with an interactive, web app based interface and a dashboard which illustrates key metrics.
