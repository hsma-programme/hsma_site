The aim of this project is to create an open source application to generate interactive theograph visuals to understand a patients'/clients' journey through a system.

The goal is to make a generic application requiring the minimum of data fields so it can be used in different healthcare or social care settings (working with dynamic 'Event_Type' values).

More information about theographs can be found [here](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/a-10-year-story-visualising-patient-journeys).
