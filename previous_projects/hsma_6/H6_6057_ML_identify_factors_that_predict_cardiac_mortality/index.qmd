This project will use machine learning and explainable AI techniques to try to identify the factors that predict cardiac mortality.

The project will use a large, complex patient-level database which includes 111, SUS and ambulance data.

The aim is to help identify where resourcing nationally should best be placed to decrease cardiac mortality.
