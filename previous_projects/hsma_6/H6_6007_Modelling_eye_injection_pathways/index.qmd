    The project aims to develop a flexible simulation model to optimise anti-VEGF treatment strategies in ophthalmology. It will use dual modelling frameworks, a modular design, and an interactive dashboard. The model will analyse clinical effectiveness, costs, and resource requirements, adapting to new treatments. The objective is to provide a tool to improve patient outcomes and optimize resource use and costs.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive and flexible simulation model to optimise anti-VEGF treatment strategies in ophthalmology. The model will address the complex challenges in anti-VEGF treatments, including frequent injections, multiple treatment options, and diverse strategies, whilst considering the significant resource consumption and high costs associated with these treatments.

Key features of the project include:

- Dual modelling approach using Mesa and SimPy frameworks to determine the most suitable platform.
- Modular design to accommodate various treatment strategies, drug efficacies, and clinic capacities.
- User-friendly interface with interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore different scenarios.
- Analysis of clinical effectiveness, costs, and resource requirements for various treatment approaches.
- Adaptability to incorporate new drugs and treatment paradigms as they emerge.

Project Objectives: The project aims to provide a tool for data-driven decision-making in ophthalmology clinic management, potentially improving patient outcomes whilst optimising resource use and costs.
