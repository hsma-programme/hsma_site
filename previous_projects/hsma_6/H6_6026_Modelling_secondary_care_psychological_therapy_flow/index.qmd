    This project models the Portsmouth Mental Health Hub using Discrete Event Simulation to assess call waiting times, durations, and staff utilisation. As demand grows, the model and web-based app will inform resource planning and service improvements, helping ensure timely, effective support for individuals seeking mental health advice and guidance.

The Mental Health hub in Portsmouth is a relatively new service. It acts as a call centre providing signposting, advice and guidance to those who contact them.

Current service capacity to answer and manage calls was based on estimates of anticipated demand. Routes into the service are now being expanded and demand will potentially grow.

This project will use Discrete Event Simulation to model call waiting times, call duration and resource utilisation.

A web based app will be developed to support ongoing service development.
