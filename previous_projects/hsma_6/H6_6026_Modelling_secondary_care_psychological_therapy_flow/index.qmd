    The project aims to improve patient flow for severe mental health treatment by assessing and projecting service user pathways under various conditions. It will provide statistical reasoning for future changes to enhance patient experience. Outputs include time in system, queue lengths, resource utilisation rates, and probabilities of exceeding thresholds for queue length, queue time, and resource utilisation.

Poor patient pathway flow is leading to long waits for patient to receive treatment for severe and enduring mental health problems. The current focus is for Adult mental health service to hit waiting times targets.

The aim of this project is to assess and project service user pathway, with different conditions (e.g. caseload number, staff members, treatment frequency).

The project will aim to give statistical reasoning for changes for future projections, to improve patient experience through a better flow through the pathway.

Proposed outputs include:

- time service users are in system
- queue length and duration for queues of interest
- rate of resource utilisation (i.e. % of time a resource is in use for activities in the model)
- probability of exceeding a defined queue length / queue time / resource utilisation threshold
