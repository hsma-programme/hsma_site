    This project aims to use geographic mapping with national health and census data to assess if we are caring for a fair represent the population. It will map some characteristics to include cancer/non-cancer status and protected characteristics like gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ethnicity. This understanding can support funding for specific areas and target referrals from underrepresented groups.

Using national health and census data, the aim of this project is to use geographic mapping to show if we are caring for a fair representation of our population. The two populations to be mapped would be based on the same characteristics to include cancer/non-cancer status, protected characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity.

This would help us to understand our population and could be used to support funding for specific geographical areas or targeting referrals from underrepresented groups.
