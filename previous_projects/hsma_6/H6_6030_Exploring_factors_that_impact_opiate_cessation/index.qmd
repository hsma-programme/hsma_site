Many patients prescribed opiate medication for acute pain relief end up taking the medication for many years, leading to adverse events, dependence and tolerance. There is currently a drive to reduce the numbers of patients on long term opiate prescriptions.

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of successful opiate cessation with an aim of exploring the driving factors behind successful or unsuccessful cessation.
