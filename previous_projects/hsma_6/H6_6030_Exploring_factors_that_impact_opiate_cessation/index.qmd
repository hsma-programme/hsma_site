    Many patients on opiates for acute pain continue long-term, causing adverse effects and dependence. Efforts are underway to reduce long-term opiate use. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict successful opiate cessation and explore factors influencing cessation success.

Many patients prescribed opiate medication for acute pain relief end up taking the medication for many years, leading to adverse events, dependence and tolerance. There is currently a drive to reduce the numbers of patients on long term opiate prescriptions.

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of successful opiate cessation with an aim of exploring the driving factors behind successful or unsuccessful cessation.
