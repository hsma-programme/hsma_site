    This project tests agent-based modelling, using consumer behaviour theory, criminology, and domain knowledge. The project aims to create a general methodology for digital behaviour models, applicable to specific cases, and develop methods to present findings static and interactively.

I work in a field that researches the use of technology by criminals. Often, we want to understand how the use and behaviours for a new technology might develop, or have developed in a criminal population.  This project aims to test how agent based modelling could be used to investigate this problem.

The inputs to the model will be a mixture of consumer behaviour theory, criminology and domain knowledge.

The project will aim to develop a documented general methodology pattern for developing digital behaviour models that can be applied to specific use cases and static and interactive methods to present findings.
