The aim of this project is to create a machine learning-based population segmentation model for the GP-registered Dorset population using multiple characteristics including primary and secondary healthcare utilisation.

We want to identify population segments based on care needs to inform service design.

This has the potential to provide enhanced patient understanding leading to improved resource allocation.
