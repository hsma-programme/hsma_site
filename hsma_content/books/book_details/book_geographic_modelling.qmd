        Anybody have a map? We do! This book takes you through a range of key geographical concepts, as well as how to build maps in both the free point-and-click tool QGIS and in the Python programming language. We also take a dive into the world of optimisation problems, learning how to find the optimum solution to the question "where should I place my services?" - taking a brief detour to the world of travel times on our way.
