      It's all well and good having an amazing bit of Python code - but how can you go about sharing that with the people in your organisation who don't use Python? In this book, we introduce the fantastic Streamlit package - a beginner-friendly web development framework that will have you creating interactive data apps in minutes, not weeks.
      <br/><br/>
      Covering everything from 'Hello Streamlit!' to deploying your app on a free web hosting service, this book is great for beginners to the world of web development.
      <br/><br/>
      For the more seasoned Streamlit user, you will find a handy reference guide for a range of techniques, including multi-page apps, adding download buttons, partial reruns, custom styling, caching, session state, the stlite framework for browser-based code execution, and more.
