    This module serves as an introduction to machine learning methods in Python. Students make use of packages including scikit-learn and tensorflow to train and assess machine learning models that can classify data into groups or predict a numeric value (e.g. length of stay). 
    <br/><br/>
    It covers
    <br/>&#x2022; Key machine learning concepts, such as train-test splits, accuracy, the bias-variance trade-off, and more  
    <br/>&#x2022; Preparing data for machine learning with one-hot encoding, feature engineering
    <br/>&#x2022; Machine learning ethics
    <br/>&#x2022; Tackling classification problems with machine learning
    <br/>&#x2022; Tackling regression problems (numeric predictions) with machine learning
    <br/>&#x2022; The theory of, and how to apply, a wide range of algorithms using the scikit-learn package: logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more
    <br/>&#x2022; Creating ensemble models
    <br/>&#x2022; Assessing the performance of machine learning model in classification and regression problems with accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, confusion matrices, the receiver operating curve, the ROC AUC, and more
    <br/>&#x2022; How to explain the activity of black-box models with techniques such as individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, partial dependence plots (PDPs), SHAP values, and more
    <br/>&#x2022; Calibrating models for obtaining prediction probabilities
    <br/>&#x2022; Optimising model parameters efficiently with grid search and the optuna framework
    <br/>&#x2022; Optimising the selected features with a range of feature selection approaches
    <br/>&#x2022; Creating neural networks for classification problems with the tensorflow package 
    <br/>&#x2022; The principles of reinforcement learning
    <br/>&#x2022; Creating synthetic data with SMOTE
