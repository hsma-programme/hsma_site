    In this session, we explore how we can model pathway and queuing problems using a modelling method known as Discrete Event Simulation.
    <br/><br/>
    We explore how Discrete Event Simulations work, covering the terminology and concepts you will need to understand before you start designing your own simulation models.
    <br/><br/>
    This content is also covered in part 1 of the HSMA little book of DES.
