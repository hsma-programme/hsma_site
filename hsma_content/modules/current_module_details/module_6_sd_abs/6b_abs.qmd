    In this session, we begin looking at Agent Based Simulation - a simulation modelling approach that allows us to capture individual level behaviours of actors in our system, and observe the emergent dynamics.  
    <br/><br/>
    We also take a look at Cellular Automata, and head to the Edge of Chaos.
