  This module serves as an introduction to creating maps and solving geographical problems in Python.
  <br/><br/>
  The module begins with an overview of key geographic concepts, including projections, coordinate reference systems, and levels of geographic data in use within the UK.
  <br/><br/>
  It then moves on to the usage of the free program QGIS, allowing maps to be made in a powerful point-and-click tool without making use of code. In QGIS, we cover
  <br/>&#x2022; Loading in geographic data stored in a range of formats, including geoJSON, geopackages, shapefiles, and csv files
  <br/>&#x2022; Displaying point data
  <br/>&#x2022; Displaying area data (creation of choropleths)]
  <br/>&#x2022; Enhancing QGIS maps with labels, custom colour groups, icons, and more
  <br/>&#x2022; Creating custom print layouts to display one or multiple QGIS maps along with titles, text and legends
  <br/><br/>
  The next part of the module covers working with geographic data in Python. 
  <br/>&#x2022; Loading in geographic data (e.g. geoJSON, geopackages, shapefiles) with the geopandas package
  <br/>&#x2022; Converting pandas dataframes into geopandas dataframes
  <br/>&#x2022; Visualising point data and area data in static maps using matplotlib
  <br/>&#x2022; Customising and polishing static matplotlib maps 
  <br/>&#x2022; Visualising point data and area data in static maps using folium
  <br/>&#x2022; Working with and visualising travel time matrices
  <br/>&#x2022; Obtaining travel time data for multiple modes of transport from free APIs using the routingpy package 
  <br/>&#x2022; Obtaining and visualising isochrone data
  <br/><br/>
  The module ends with an exploration of how to solve geographic optimisation problems - placing a number of sites in a way that minimises and objective like average travel time or distance - in Python. The module gives code examples for brute force solutions, but touches on more the more advanced evolutionary and genetic algorithm approaches and the value of multiobjective optimisation.
