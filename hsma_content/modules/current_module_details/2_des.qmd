  abstract:
   This module serves as an introduction to modelling pathway problems with discrete event simulation (DES).

    <br/><br/>It covers
    <br/>&#x2022; What DES is and where it may be useful
    <br/>&#x2022; The key terminology associated with DES (e.g. resources, entities, sinks)
    <br/>&#x2022; How to simplify a real-world pathway modelling problem into a conceptual model 
    <br/>&#x2022; Python generator functions
    <br/>&#x2022; The features of the SimPy package
    <br/>&#x2022; How to write simple simulations in Python with SimPy
    <br/>&#x2022; How to deal with multi-step pathways
    <br/>&#x2022; How to deal with branching pathways
    <br/>&#x2022; How to build in more complex features to your pathway models, including warm-up periods; priority-based queuing; resource unavailability; Lognormal distributions; reneging; balking; jockeying
