    In this session, we spend a bit of time learning about Quarto, allowing you to create good-looking reports that weave together code, text, images and more in a neat, easily-distributable format. We also have a look at using a Python script to interact with the command line and produce multiple outputs from a single Quarto file using different parameters.
    <br/><br/>
    We then briefly dive into the world of xlsxwriter - a handy tool for automatically producing Excel spreadsheets from your Python code.
