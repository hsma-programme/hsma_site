    In this session, we introduce the HSMA programme and your trainers.
    <br/><br/>
    We take a look at some myths about programming and some reccomendations for how you might approach your programming journey.
    <br/><br/>
    We explore why the programme has a commitment to open-source software and why this matters, particularly for organisations like the NHS.
