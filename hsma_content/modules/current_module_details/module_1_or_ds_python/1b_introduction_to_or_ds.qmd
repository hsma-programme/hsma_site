    In this session, we introduce the fields of operational research and data science. We explore why modelling is beneficial and get a brief overview of some of the techniques that will be tackled on the course.
    <br/><br/>
    We also take a look at the process of conceptual modelling and some of the key steps you would need to undertake in your own modelling projects, such as process mapping and stakeholder analysis.
    <br/><br/>
    We also start to explore the concepts of variability and probability distributions.
    <br/><br/>
    Finally, we take a look at the idea of model validation.
