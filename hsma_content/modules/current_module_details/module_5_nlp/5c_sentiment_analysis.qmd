    In this session we explore the process of sentiment analysis with neural networks, making use of TensorFlow and the Keras API to attempt to classify whether text is positive or negative. 
    <br/><br/>
    We look at how to process our raw text data ready for use in the process, train these models, and then save our trained model for use on unseen data.
