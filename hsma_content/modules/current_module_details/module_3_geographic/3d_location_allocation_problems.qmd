    In this session we talk about how you would tackle a problem where you need to most efficiently place a certain number of sites to minimise the travel time, population-weighted travel time, or distance for a population across a region. We construct and carry out the p-median location allocation problem in Python, using our mapping skills and travel time matrices from the previous sessions in this module.
