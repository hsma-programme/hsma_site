    In this module we start by taking a look at a crucial skill for the analyst, data science or operational researcher's toolbox - version control with Git. Git ensures that the full history of your code is available, allowing you to
    <br/>&#x2022; roll back to earlier versions of code
    <br/>&#x2022; keep a clean working copy of code safe and accessible while being able to start working on new features
    <br/><br/>
    Say goodbye to V2, V3_FINAL, and V_ACTUAL_FINAL_VERSION - with Git, you will always know where you are.
    <br/><br/>
    We then explore the online platform GitHub, which allows for hosting of code folders that are controlled using Git. GitHub is possibly the most used code-sharing and collaboration platform in the world, and is a crucial part of ensuring your code is available for others to audit, use and build on.
    <br/><br/>
    We then move on to creating web interfaces. With the advent of a range of tools that are designed to make it easier for people to create data-driven web apps and interactive model interfaces without having to learn the intricacies of traditional web development, it's a great time to start developing your own interfaces to get your scripts into the hands of others - without them having to install or use the code directly.
    <br/><br/>
    In this module, we'll be working with the Streamlit framework - a beginner-friendly but powerful Python library that will get your writing your first interactive apps in minutes.
    <br/><br/>
    We will cover
    <br/>&#x2022; creating simple apps
    <br/>&#x2022;  adding interactive elements like sliders, text and numeric inputs, dropdowns, and more
    <br/>&#x2022;  adding outputs such as dataframes, interactive plots, and maps
    <br/>&#x2022;  theming your app
    <br/>&#x2022;  using layout elements such as tabs, columns, expanders, sidebars, and multi-page navigation
    <br/>&#x2022;  improving the running of your app with advanced features like caching, fragments and sessin state
    <br/><br/>
    We will round off the module by practicing our Git and GitHub skills, uploading our apps to a GitHub repository so we can then host them on the Streamlit Community Cloud platform.
