In this model we start by taking a look at a crucial skill for the analyst, data science or operational researcher's toolbox - version control with Git. Git ensures that the full history of your code is available, allowing you to

- roll back to earlier versions of code
- keep a clean working copy of code while being able

We then explore the online platform GitHub, which allows for hosting of code folders that are controlled using Git. GitHub is possibly the most used code-sharing and collaboration platform in the world, and is a crucial part of ensuring your code is available for others to audit, use and build on.

We then move on to creating web interfaces. With the advent of a range of tools that are designed to make it easier for people to create data-driven web apps and interactive model interfaces without having to learn the intricacies of traditional web development, it's a great time to start developing your own interfaces to get your scripts into the hands of others - without them having to install or use the code directly.

In this module, we'll be working with the Streamlit framework - a beginner-friendly but powerful Python library that will get your writing your first interactive apps in minutes.

We will cover

- creating simple apps
- adding interactive elements like sliders, text and numeric inputs, dropdowns, and more
- adding outputs such as dataframes, interactive plots, and maps
- theming your app
- using layout elements such as tabs, columns, expanders, sidebars, and multi-page navigation
- improving the running of your app with advanced features like caching, fragments and sessin state

We will round off the module by practicing our Git and GitHub skills, uploading our apps to a GitHub repository so we can then host them on the Streamlit Community Cloud platform.
