    Today we're going to start looking at building web apps entirely in Python using the fantastic Streamlit framework.
    <br/><br/>
    In this first session, we cover
    <br/>&#x2022; how to run a Streamlit app locally
    <br/>&#x2022; the simple building blocks of Streamlit apps, like titles, text, images, videos, metric cards, and information boxes
    <br/>&#x2022; how to obtain and use input from the user in a range of ways, such as text inputs, date pickers, numeric range sliders, dropdowns, and more
    <br/>&#x2022; displaying and editing dataframes 
    <br/>&#x2022; displaying static and interactive graphs and maps 
    <br/>&#x2022; laying out your dashboard with columns, tabs, expanders
    <br/>&#x2022; allowing the user to upload files
    <br/>&#x2022; creating download buttons for charts, maps and dataframes
