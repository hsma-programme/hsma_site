We're excited to share this great blog post about a project undertaken by our fantastic HSMA 6 associate, John Williams, who went from never having coded in Python to producing a highly impactful simulation model to identify ways to improve stroke care.

This model identified the potential for £2 million in cost savings while also having the potential to improve the outcomes and experience for individual patients.
