**The HSMA team are running a live, in-person workshop on discrete event simulation on 16th June 2025 (1000 - 1430)**

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Register for your free place here: [https://forms.office.com/e/7L6TWFreV2](https://forms.office.com/e/7L6TWFreV2)!

Note that this is an **in-person** event taking place at the St Austell Conference Centre, Cornwall, England.

We have a limited number of places available for this workshop - we will email you to confirm if your registration request has been accepted.

Health and social care systems are full of queueing and resourcing problems, such as

- reducing waiting times to access treatment
- optimising flows through pathways in hospitals and clinics
- managing bed demand
- managing capacity for ongoing appointments
- and planning new services and their resourcing

Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a powerful technique that uses computer simulation to create models of current system flows and resources, allowing us to test out changes in the "virtual" system to assess what might happen if these changes were made in the real world.

In this workshop you will learn

- how DES works
- how it can and has been used in healthcare
- interpret model outputs for decision making
- and interact with DES models via user friendly web apps

No previous knowledge of discrete event simulation or computer programming is required to attend this workshop - just an interest in learning how these techniques could be applied to problems in your own system.
