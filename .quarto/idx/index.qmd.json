applying operational research and data science techniques to a real problem within their organisation\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Our Materials\n\nRecordings of the course, as well as all of our course materials, are offered **free of charge** to anyone, anywhere in the world, for personal use and adaptation.\n\nHead over to our [books](hsma_content/books/books.qmd) or our [HSMA 6 content recordings](hsma_content/modules/modules.qmd) to work through this year's course at your own pace - for free!\n\n## Our Projects\n\nWhile HSMA involves a large training element, the main focus of the programme is to support participants to undertake their own projects in their organisations.\n\nOn the website you can find more out about our [projects that are currently in progress](previous_projects/projects_in_progress.qmd) or [projects that have previously been undertaken](previous_projects/completed_projects.qmd).\n\nYou can also view projects [by method](previous_projects/projects_by_methods.qmd), [by area of application](previous_projects/projects_by_service_area.qmd), [by HSMA cohort](previous_projects/projects_by_cohort.qmd) or [by service](previous_projects/projects_by_organisation.qmd).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"include-in-header":[{"text":"<link
