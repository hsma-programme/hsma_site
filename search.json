    "text": "My IT department is concerned about installing open source software. What is your advice?\nMany IT departments are not used to installing non-proprietary software and may have concerns, such as security or support concerns. All software used on the programme is highly reputable and widely used across the world for Data Science. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) does not consider the security risks of open-source coding to be significant, and instead actually helps to promote good security practices (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/developers-collection). The NCSC has also published guidance on how to develop in a secure way : https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/developers-collection/principles/protect-your-code-repository.\nCentral NHS organisations are now heavily promoting and encouraging the use of Free and Open Source (FOSS) technologies and ways of working as the NHS moves its analytical capabilities into the wider world of Data Science and modelling. Those interested in finding out more should check out:\n\nThe NHS England Open Source Programme at https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/open-source\nThe NHS-X Blog on what it means to be an “open source organisation” at: https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/04/23/what-does-it-mean-for-nhsx-to-be-an-open-source-organisation\nThe NHS-R community, which has helped to establish R as a routinely used open-source analytical tool in the NHS: https://nhsrcommunity.com/about\n\nIt is also important to highlight that all software has potential vulnerabilities, including the proprietary software that you already have installed. Therefore, good software security practices should be maintained regardless of the software you are using."

The plan was to combine this information into a dataset and use machine learning techniques to predict which of our wards were most likely to suffer from an incident the following day. A dashboard would highlight these wards to senior nursing staff, who could experiment with actions to reduce incidents.\nDiscussions with key staff helped to identify which features from our systems would be the most helpful in predicting incidents. A large dataset was constructed, and machine learning methods were used in an attempt to predict where incidents might happen. Unfortunately, the dataset did not prove to be informative enough to generate a working model – the predictions made were inaccurate and there was no way to apply them to the work environment."

Stakeholders feel that a major constraint is patients waiting in WB3/AMRA who are ready to be moved to a ward bed.\nThe team wanted to investigate what the impact would be if patients were able to leave WB3/AMRA more quickly. What would this do to the backlog of queues in ED, and how would it affect waiting times there?\nA Discrete Event Simulation (DES) was made of the entire Acute Medicine assessment pathway. They then simulated several alternative scenarios in which patients leave WB3/AMRA more quickly after their period of assessment is completed – and were able to see the impact of this in the key metrics.\nIf all patients left WB3/AMRA within four hours of their request for a ward bed, patients would never have to wait in ED for a WB3/AMRA bed for more than 6 hours. Even if all patients left WB3/AMRA within 16 hours of their request, this would still reduce the number of patients waiting more than 6 hours by 90% - substantially reducing the risk of delay-related harm\nWe can now start to quantify the number of additional ward beds that would need to be freed up to support this improved flow, and bring these findings to discussions on how/where additional bed days could be released."

They used current and historic data of people waiting or seen for therapy, attendance rates, and meeting with the data lead and service managers within Steps 2 Wellbeing, in order to gain an accurate picture of the waiting and treatment pathway for patients.\nThe model does confirm that the longest wait times appear to be for people waiting for face-to-face or evening 1-1 appointments. The model shows improvements in waiting times when an evening group is changed to a 1-1 face-to-face evening clinic.\nThe team is making changes to the model based on stakeholder feedback and will present to senior management within the service."

    "text": "The aim of the project was to understand the current pathway to assessment of Autism and ADHD in children, identifying any bottlenecks. We wanted to know what change needed to take place in order to keep on top of ongoing demand levels and see patients within an acceptable time - what do we need to do to maintain a steady state and avoid a backlog from developing?\nIn addition to maintaining a steady state, we wanted to understand how to eliminate the backlog that has developed as a result of the ongoing demand not being met.\nThe main bottlenecks were identified and the issue is not at the beginning of the pathway (getting the completed questionnaires back from parents/schools) like it has been suggested at the start of the project, but further down the pathway due to clinical staffing capacity. Furthermore, the developed model shows that recruiting just one extra clinician would result in having a steady state with the backlog not growing. The model also shows possible staffing requirements to remove existing backlog in 1-5 years in addition to keeping a steady state.\nThe findings and the model demo have been presented to the stakeholders including service managers, clinical and operational leads, service heads and the Trust board, and discussions on plans for how the model is used to support any improvement work in the service is already taking place."

The team wanted to understand what further staff and resources would be required for any variations in patient attendance. The ED team wanted to understand how changes in the patient pathway would reduce bottlenecks, for example, what would be the impact of front-loading diagnostics.\nInitially, a discrete event simulation model was developed to show how patients currently flow through UTC. After an initial model had been developed, it was used to test the proposed alternative pathways for diagnostics. It was also used to model different numbers of staff and rooms. The model made it easy to understand the impact of changes to the existing provision and what would be most cost-effective.\nThe ED department was redesigned based on the model findings, which identified a need for additional rooms leading to reconfiguration of the space. It started a review of staffing rotas to see how they could be better aligned to findings from the analysis and future staffing rotas are designed to align with what the model identified was needed to meet the 95% target."

If successful, this could then be adapted and applied to further crime types at a later date.\nThe aim was to create a model that would be able to make predictions on future datasets by classifying each piece of text into drug/non-drug related content, to prevent manual coding of the data. To achieve this, the team used a machine learning technique known as Natural Language Processing, to train various models on the structure of text and any patterns in language.\nThe team created a model pipeline to automate this process end-to-end. Initial findings suggesting these techniques could be rather successful, however, it has only been possible to test this on dummy data at present. If this were to be implemented as a permanent solution, this could potentially be made available to the wider policing community through the development of a Streamlit app, which could greatly assist in reducing the amount of data and time taken to review each dataset manually."

In some cases that will be an admission to hospital, but increasingly this may involve alternatives that combine just a few hours in hospital with close follow up and perhaps even forms of remote monitoring, like monitoring their heart through a mobile app.\nThe aim of this project was to model part of the acute medical pathway in this hospital trust, simulate how the system currently works, and investigate whether there is optimal allocation of staff and resources. The benefit of this model is it allows for changing parameters such as adding extra staffing to see what impact that has on the pathway. Testing these changes in the real-world costs time and money, while computer simulation allows you to trial these changes with minimal cost and no risk.\nThe model isn’t validated yet, but when it is it’ll be handed over to users (e.g. clinicians and managers) to support them in making decisions about staffing or resourcing. They’ll be able to test those changes mentioned above without risk before proceeding to a real-world test of change.\n\nAccess the Github Repository"

This limits how much data can be used to make forecasts, and the techniques that can be deployed. There was a desire to explore other forecasting methods to see if they could obtain more accurate forecasts, and also to valid the forecasts that are being made using the existing model. Understanding demand is important to manage wait lists, which is a high priority for the NHS, hence the interest in modelling clock starts.\nThe aim of the project was to explore different ways of forecasting demand, evaluate their performance and offer suggestions as to how forecasting could be done in the future.\nThe team carried out exploratory data analysis to understand differences between different data types and the differences in the patterns of demand for different subgroupings. They built a codebase that loaded the required data and ran model functions for Naïve, ARIMA, Prophet and a combination of Linear Regression and Random Forest. They evaluated the performance of these models to each other, and the modelling technique currently used. They also made some progress on rebuilding the current excel model in Python.\nThey found that while the more performant models that we used performed well (produced low error metrics), they generally didn’t perform as well as the model currently used within the organisation. This suggested that a helpful next step of the project might be to complete the work of translating the excel model into python and doing further work to understand if they can get more data to better understand the drivers of demand beyond just time series."

CDCs and commissioners struggle to identify their baseline of healthcare inequalities and monitor their impact going forwards. This leads to resourcing constraints on teams in the short term and risks minimising the CDC’s impact on healthcare inequalities in the long term. As these are emerging services, the quality of data collected by them to understand their impact is unclear. This impact can be estimated through a health equity audit, however this is usually and long and manual process.\nThe aim of the project was to create an open source and shareable tool to:\n\nPerform a health equity audit to identify where the service may be having an impact on healthcare inequalities\nIdentify where data may be incomplete or poor quality, and automatically suggest evidence-based strategies to improve the data\n\nThis has been achieved through development of Python code to process data and a Streamlit app to present data. This project involved developing a toolkit to explore inequalities for multiple sites. Through trialling this toolkit with dummy data for different sites we have developed metrics would be most suitable to identify different regions.\nThe team would like to further develop the tool to make it more widely applicable and include more robust analysis of inequalities. They are planning to engage with local and national stakeholders of CDCs to demonstrate the tool and gather feedback. They are also planning to implement changes suggested by the Patient and Public Involvement Group (PenPEG).\nThe tool itself, at a minimum, will support a local CDC to understand their local impact on healthcare inequalities and address areas of concern where relevant. It’s an example to demonstrate the power of open-source techniques and data in healthcare inequalities. If adopted by multiple regions, it would allow different regions to generate similar outputs which would allow for easier comparison and sharing of learning. The code developed could also be easily adapted and reused for other healthcare services beyond CDCs."

The project focused on optimizing staffing within current time constraints to enhance A&E performance and the conversion rate from attendances to emergency admissions.\nA base case was established, and various staffing scenarios were modelled, exploring approximately 40 possible configurations. The model was designed to be simple for ease of understanding while also complex enough to track patient types and key hospital processes. The main focus was on identifying pinch points in patient flow and improving 4-hour performance.\nThe analysis revealed that both nursing and doctor staffing were already close to optimal, but minor adjustments could improve performance. However, unsafe options or those that might affect recruitment and retention were eliminated. Optimizations were found within the current staffing budget, and these scenarios were tested during a “Perfect Fortnight” initiative, alongside 36 other improvement efforts.\nThe project achieved notable success, with the 4-hour target met in Q1, Q2, and Q3, despite a 6% increase in attendances and a national breach rate of 15%. In response to challenges in meeting the target for Q4, additional investments in doctor staffing were made, which, combined with other changes, helped to achieve the standard.\nThe project’s success was attributed to a collaborative approach, with the “embedded analysis” for A&E and the role of “modelling ambassadors.” The modelling work was shared with six other Trusts in the Devon STP and extended to other operational areas, promoting system-wide improvements. Cultural change within NDHT and Devon STP led to more integrated Business Intelligence (BI) efforts, influencing decision-making and operational practices across the region."

    "text": "Problem Survival to hospital discharge in patients suffering an out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has remained nationally at around 7-8% for at least the last 6 years. Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients are not always conveyed to their nearest cardiac arrest centre. The analysis of the SWASFT Cardiac Arrest Registry (2015-2016) identified large variation in survival rates for patients conveyed to different hospitals within the South West, possibly due to variation in the services provided. Current guidelines suggest implementing a regional system of care for OHCA to improve survival rates and neurological outcomes; nonetheless it remains necessary to understand the impact of such a system on journey times and patient survival.\nMethod • Literature review of the effect of longer travel times on cardiac arrest survival rates • Identify the current OHCA patients bypassing their nearest cardiac arrest centre • Develop a binomial logistic regression to predict survival rates from patient characteristics, travel time and hospital attended • Model the impact of different regional systems of care using a geographical model in Excel • Report initial findings at a stakeholder meeting\nResults The analysis of the SWASFT Cardiac Arrest Registry confirmed that 13% of OHCA patients were bypassing their nearest cardiac arrest centre. The binomial logistic regression identified that patient characteristics (age, gender, UTSTEIN group) and hospital attended had a significant effect on survival rate. Travel time did not affect survival, although the confidence of this effect is limited to the range of travel times included in the available data (maximum 149 minutes). The geographical model suggests improvements to survival rate are expected from a regional system of care. This is supported by (1) the differences in survival rate between hospitals cannot be explained by differences in patients or travel distances alone, and (2) differences in travel times, within the ranges available in the data, do not appear to affect outcomes of patients. As with all models there are limitations associated with working assumptions and available data.\nImpact The sharing of patient data in a collaborative project between ambulance service and regional hospitals would be unprecedented and highly beneficial in understanding regional variations, and perhaps working towards standardization of care. Understandably, this project has been met with great interest by stakeholders, and they are driving a collective effort to gather data. In addition, the model has already identified gaps in the current standards of care and highlighted the potential gains that could be made from a standardised best practice across all cardiac arrest centres."

This model was developed to include all emergency medical admissions (excepting patients on stroke or cardiac pathways)\nThe model allowed data to be captured relating to what would be the average bed occupancy on both the proposed frailty assessment unit alongside the existing Medical Assessment Units and what percentage of these patients would meet the 4 hour ED Standard.\nFindings: An 18 Bedded Frailty Assessment unit (FAU) would have an average bed occupancy of 70% allowing for 99% of patients who would suit admission to FAU to be admitted, with 94% of patients waiting for a bed on FAU waiting less than four hour in ED. A 16 Bedded FAU would have an average bed occupancy of 77% of the time but the number of patients who would breach the four hour ED standard would increase by 8%\nImpact: Proposals have been made relating to reconfiguring wards working with the number of beds suggested in the model as a basis.

Identifying which patient characteristics carry the biggest risk most often comes from clinical expertise and is not data-driven. When data is considered, there is often “too much” data to look into, requiring expertise on where to start. Additionally, different geographies want to know who is most at risk in their patch and often want to be able to view the data at their geography or for their primary care network.\nThere is a need for a way to identify which patient characteristics carry the biggest risk for an outcome across different geographies.\nThe aim of this project is to create a tool to identify which patient groups are most at risk for an outcome at different geographies. The outcomes will align in the NWL INT outcomes which include:\n\nEmergency admissions due to fall in over 65s\nNot being vaccinated\nNot taking up screening\nEmergency admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions\n\nMachine Learning and Explainable AI approaches will be used to build the tool and outputs."

The smooth running of the pathway relies upon having the necessary resources allocated each of these events e.g. biopsy clinics, access to imaging etc.\nThe system is reactive- it can take months before it’s apparent the targets have not been met, and even longer to reallocate resources appropriately.\nWe want to develop a system which can anticipate the demand for resources, dependant on the number of referrals and resources allocated. The aim is to create a Discrete Event Simulation model to model the current pathway. To feed live data into the model in order to predict where bottlenecks occur and if the pathway will breach the 62 day target. Make use of forecasting methods to predicts what changes are needed in resource allocation in order to ensure the 62 day target is met.\nThe project outcome is a simulation model with an interactive, web app based interface and a dashboard which illustrates key metrics of the 2 week wait pathway"

There have also been hospital and ambulance station closures and relocations. Over the years, there have been increases in the number of emergency ambulances to meet the demand.\nToday’s issue is that the dispatch areas do not have parity in terms of how many emergency resources each are controlling and in how many allocations are made by each dispatcher. This has resulted in some dispatch areas being overwhelmed with incidents to allocate which ultimately leads to delays in responding to patients.\nThe aim of this project is to generate evidence to redraw these boundaries to make it more equitable across the three areas."

Q87.8 is broadly defined as ‘Other specified congenital malformation syndromes, not elsewhere classified’, with diagnosis detail submitted in free text data. As a result, classification of these diagnoses into more specific syndromes is currently handled manually by reviewing free text fields from data submissions from hospitals such as discharge letters. This manual review is time consuming and risks human error, duplication of effort, and poor standardisation of rules/methods applied for extraction and classification.\nAdditionally, diagnoses submitted from discharge letters are only ‘probable’ or ‘suspected’ and therefore need to be validated via genetic testing data. However, there currently is no defined method of data linkage between the discharge letters and genetic data which means diagnoses cannot be confirmed. Providing accurate data on congenital anomaly diagnoses which have been validated by genetic testing data is crucial for disease surveillance reporting.\nThe aims of this project are:\n\nTo use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate and standardise the extraction and classification of suspected ICD10 Q87.8 congenital anomaly diagnoses from free text.\nTo use genetic data to validate these suspected diagnoses, which will include defining a data linkage method between the two datasets."

Type and length of operation, patient variables and anaesthetic risk are all factors in the length of stay and turnover of patients within recovery. This problems lends itself to a queue of people leaving theatres for a recovery. However, each patient also seem to act like an autonomous agent but this will be up for discussion at the start of this project.\nCurrent system/strategy: Currently patient flow is logged via time stamps within a database system along with some patient attributes, but linking these together does not exist. With DES/ABS we have a method of queuing analysis from the many operations across the many theatres and the requirements from a recovery staff point of view.\nKey questions in this project include: Given type of surgery (keyhole, laparotomy, joint or part replacement), ASA score (score 1-5), length of anaesthetic (in time), type of anaesthesia (local, sedation or general).\n\nCan we predict an approximate length of stay in recovery from the variables?\nStaffing requirements?\nAre the above variables the important factors for patient stay?\n\nThe project goal is to provide a better understanding of workload planning for recovery staff."

This increase will not only put pressure on hospitals but also on all of society.\nThe Hyperacute stroke setting is an extremely time critical. The quicker treatment can be delivered the better a patient’s outcome. In the Acute setting, therapy takes centre stage in rehabilitating patients, with the initial few weeks being the most impactful for the patient’s recovery.\nPost stroke, patients can suffer with extreme changes to their function and wellbeing. The more severe the post stroke disability the more intensive and expensive care is needed.\nThe aim of this project is to develop a discrete simulation model to observe the potential effects of differing variables (such as staffing / operating hours of pathways and services) within the Hyperacute / Acute stroke pathway have on the following :\n\nPatient flow and medical outcomes of those patients\nDirect costs and savings made to the stroke unit itself\nThe health economic costs / benefits associated with any change"

    "text": "Over 6000 patients a year are referred to RD&E and NDDH for fast-track breast symptom diagnosis. The fast-track clinic requires a clinician, a mammography team and a consultant radiologist/radiographer plus support staff. The imaging needs to take place in specialised rooms. As population and awareness of breast cancer increases there are increasing referrals and the current infrastructure at both RD&E and NDDH will not be sufficient to meet future demand. It is therefore necessary to build a new breast diagnostic unit or extend an existing one. It is likely to be prohibitively expensive to build at both NDDH and RD&E. At present specific GP surgeries refer patients to either NDDH or RD&E. However, the two hospitals are now managed as part of a single NHS Trust called RDUH. Each hospital requires breast diagnosis infrastructure on site as it is used for inpatient and emergency admissions as well as for elective diagnosis services so we need at least two breast diagnosis centres but data science may be used to help determine whether there is a value in building a third centre and/or diverting referrals from specific GPs to one of the existing units.\nThe aim of this project is to determine where additional breast diagnostic services should be placed to minimise overall travel time for patients whilst reducing infrastructure and running costs.\nObjectives include the following:\n\nTo map breast referral demand by GP and calculate the weighted average distance and/or travel time from each GP to RD&E, NDDH and a potential central location.\nTo calculate the percentage of patients who would benefit from a central location.\nTo calculate the shortest distance/travel time from each GP to the three locations and determine the reduction or increase in mileage if patients were diverted from their current default hospital to one of the other two centres."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In winter 2020, vaccinations had recently been approved for use in the UK to protect people against the COVID-19 virus. Consequently, a mass vaccination programme was required to vaccinate most of the population of the country, which led to local GP surgeries having to pivot to deliver vaccinations for their communities at a scale and pace never seen before.\nThis project was led by a HSMA who had never undertaken any coding work before but using his training from the HSMA programme he rapidly developed a Discrete Event Simulation model of the proposed pathway and resourcing for a vaccination service in North Devon. The model was able to predict not only the rate at which patients could be vaccinated with proposed resourcing, but also the potential risks of social distancing breaches in the waiting room and overflowing in the carpark. The model identified potential issues with the proposed plans, and was used to refine the plans to enable a safe but efficient delivery of the vaccinations in North Devon.\nThe HSMA also worked with the South West Academic Health Science Network (AHSN) to develop a generic version of the model that could be used for any future vaccination services, and has made the model available Free and Open Source for anyone to use anywhere in the world:\nDr Kwiatkowski said: “I enjoyed designing it. It predicts queue lengths, car park capacity and times for every step of the vaccination process in the clinic to avoid overcrowded waiting rooms. In the winter of 2020/1 the country was back in lock down and there seemed no end in sight regarding COVID. The vaccines seemed like a ray of hope and setting up the clinics was instrumental in turning the tide. Being able to use the knowledge gained from the HSMA course to help design the process was fantastic. The clinic has now delivered over 100,000 vaccines.”"

The project incorporated the views of a PPI group who helped to highlight the importance of patient medical history and co-morbidities in the model.\nPhase 1 of the model used call-taker info (dispatch code and other items) plotted against conveyance. A series of Logistic Regression models was trained to test out optimal sample sizes and model regularisation, to boost accuracy. This led to Algorithm generation for phase 2, to test whether the scoring methodology in the Risk Stratification model could locate codes ‘not requiring an ambulance’.\nThe risk stratification model is in active use, increasing HART team utilisation, and leading to a trial of Enhanced Hear and Treat. The project allowed for a balanced pragmatic approach by senior decision makers."

    "text": "Category 1 ambulance calls are the most serious. They are immediately life threatening and, in 2018, approximately 8% of calls in the South West fell into this category. After the triage the call is passed to the dispatchers who co-ordinate the available resources and aim to meet these response times. The response time is the time from the call being made to the arrival of an appropriate ambulance resource on scene. At the beginning of 2018, the ambulance trust was not meeting these times and our number one priority was to reduce the time taken to get to category 1 calls.\nThe aim of this project was to explore what would happen if dispatchers reserved a portion of resources for the higher acuity calls. Specifically : • What is the optimum level of resources to “hold back” in order to meet the needs of category 1 patients? • What impact would this have on the lower acuity patients? • What is the optimum balance between these two?\nA discrete event simulation model was built which could specify a certain number of resources to reserve for category 1 calls. When a call comes in, if it is category 1 call it is allocated an ambulance as soon as one is available. If it is any of the other lower priority categories, an ambulance will only be allocated if this will leave at least the reserved number of ambulances available."

It supports commissioning decision making and helps to focus the team in specific areas within the system.”"

Separate data and models were built for each locality for weekdays and weekends. Pathways were modelled for each service.\nThe model helped demonstrate the demand and capacity of the system, allowing for appropriate resources to be planned to support the cafes, and associated financial decisions to be made."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On the day surgical cancellations can offer a poor patient experience - there can be multiple cancellations for some patients, and in early 2018 University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust ranked as one of the worst for cancellations. The aim of this project was to explore whether AI approaches could be used to create a model that can inform decision making around cancellations, sooner.\nThere were three key questions for the Machine learning model to answer: - Should I cancel a patient today? - How many patients should I cancel? - Which patient/s should I cancel?\nA model was trained but performance was poor – there was insufficient data to allow the model to be able to replicate the human decision making taking place.\nAs a second project, the Trust used geospatial visualisation approaches (using QGIS software) to explore demand for community outpatient clinics. The work found that there were increasing waiting lists and poor utilisation of clinics. These results were used to improve their ability to book appropriate patients into Peripheral Sites."

However, you can now register and begin projects early if you so wish! Can HSMAs do multiple smaller projects in the inception project phase, or is this discouraged? HSMAs can do as many or as few as they wish, and we’ve had HSMAs before that have done this. This is even easier now, as anyone can start and finish a project at any time they choose. Sometimes, it can be useful to have something else in your back pocket as you realise how long it’s going to take to get the data you need for a project… The only thing I would say to anyone is be cautious about being too ambitious with project ideas or numbers if you only have a day a week on this. A day a week for 9 months isn’t a huge amount of time - you are (generally) much better off carving off something useful and doable that you can build on, rather than trying to start big by trying to do too much."

For areas like this, or things like machine learning techniques or natural language processing techniques that we don’t explictly teach, we can generally still support projects in this area to some extent - we just may be able to provide less in-depth support on the techniques themselves if they’re not something we directly teach and have used ourselves, but there may be other people in the community who can help!"

It is recommended that students install the qgis_trackable_project_files and use the .qgs format.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship of code and other materials should be made clear.\n\nThis is particularly important for projects involving multiple HSMAs, so that each HSMA involved can provide a case for their certification.\n\n\nOn submission, HSMA Programme staff will look over the work provided.\n\nThey will determine whether the work demonstrates that the author(s) have sufficiently understood the techniques adopted, and have produced good quality code.\n\nIf so, certification will be provided.\nIf not, staff will contact the HSMA(s) involved in the first instance to explore\n\nif there is further evidence that they can provide, or\nadvise them to resubmit at a later stage when the project has advanced further, or\nif neither of these are possible, to direct them to undertake a subsequent assessment if they still wish to be certified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision of programme staff is final, but extensive discussion will take place for any proposed rejections of evidence before any such decision is taken to ensure that the decision is fair."

    "text": "Option 2: Undertake the HSMA 6 Assessment\nIf participants are not undertaking a HSMA project, or would prefer to receive certification sooner, they can choose to undertake the HSMA 6 Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment will take place on 28th January 2025 at 1000 - 1200.\nStudents should join this session using the normal HSMA Zoom Link.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants who wish to undertake the assessment must undertake the assessment live unless there are extenuating circumstances (which must be discussed with the programme staff ahead of time). Participants will have 90 minutes from the start of the assessment to submit their solutions. Instructions for how to do this, and how the assessment will be released, will be provided in an introductory 30 minute session on the day.\nThere is no plan to provide an alternative assessment on a different date.\nHSMAs can choose to undertake an assessment for a future round should they fail or not choose or be able to take the HSMA 6 assessment. Details of future assessments will be shared with the community on Slack. However, we cannot at any point ‘guarantee’ future rounds (and therefore future assessments) as the HSMA programme is dependent on fixed term funding. Alternatively, students who fail or are unable to take the assessment can instead opt to go down the project-based assessment route.\nParticipants are required to have a working, local installation of Python, along with the ability to work with Jupyter Notebooks, to undertake the assessment. Some questions will benefit from the HSMA having access to prior environments set up during the training phase to test solutions, though code can still be written and submitted without this.\nThe assessment is “open book” - therefore, HSMAs are welcome to refer to any notes they choose to help them answer the questions. However, plagiarism is strictly prohibited, and this includes using an AI tool to write the code for you. HSMA programme staff and others HSMAs also cannot be used to ask for help during the assessment.\nThe assessment consists of three “core” questions which test basic Python skills, and a series of additional questions, from which HSMAs should choose any two to answer. These additional questions are based on the various modelling and data science approaches taught in Phase 1.\nThe assessment is supplied as a Jupyter Notebook. Each question in the assessment asks the HSMA to write some code in the corresponding code cell to achieve a task. Typically, some code will already be present in the code cell, and the HSMA must simply add code to the cell where indicated.\nEach question is worth a set number of marks (with all non-core questions awarding equal marks). If the code written by the HSMA works and does what is asked, then full marks for the question are awarded. If not, marks are awarded at the marker’s discretion depending on how close to a working solution they were. The HSMA Programme staff will mark the assessments.\nTo pass the assessment and receive certification, a HSMA must achieve at least 50% of the available marks. There is no distinction in certification for marks awarded above this.\nThe decision of the markers is final. However, all potential “fail” cases will be moderated by both markers to ensure that the decision is fair and consistent with other marks awarded.\nAll marked submissions will be returned to participants so they can see how they scored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment will be released afterwards so that anyone can use it as practice or revision material, though it will not be possible to complete it at that point to gain accreditation."

Also, a Tertiary referral centre for specialised surgeries. This is impacting on elective lists as not enough capacity to do alongside emergency cases. Having a financial impact on the Trust due to money Orthopaedics brings in but activity is unable to happen due to emergency cases, waiting lists increasing. Harder to get patients back from elsewhere due to lack of resource/capacity.\nAim: To create a DES model showing the major trauma and elective surgery pathways in Orthopaedics and experiment with adding extra theatre slots and/or increasing capacity elsewhere in the pathway to improve flow and the waiting list.\nProposed outputs: Initial analysis of demand, patient type, IP/OP LOS/capacity Interactive DES Model to adjust various capacity metrics (e.g. number of sessions, slots, resource capacity). I may also do a bit of geographical modelling to see where the trauma and tertiary patients are coming from. Forecasting to spot trends in time of day, seasonality, day of week in major trauma arrivals"

Nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems, and ‘simple’ modelling can still be highly impactful.\n\nConsider the possible ethical issues with your project early on.\n\nThis can be particularly tricky with machine learning projects. Refer back to the AI module - does it run into murky territory?\nOften predictions that are aggregated in some way are a safer option than those that are used to directly influence a patient’s care. For example, predicting the number of patients who are likely to be admitted to each specialty in the next 6 hours can help with optimizing bed management - but using that prediction for an individual patient to alter their pathway or care is likely to not be ok.\n\nConsider the data requirements for your proposed project. Do you need data that you know is already collected in some capacity, or would you need to collect brand new data?\n\nIs it a dataset you already have access to? If not, consider how you may be able to progress elements of the project while waiting for access to be granted. This part can often take longer than you expect.\n\nConsider the impact\n\nWhat information can you give people at the end of your project, and what will they be able to do with it?"

Some of this delay is due to provision of social care, some of this delay is due to ongoing rehabilitation (physio/occupational therapy workup).\nThe aim of this project was to create a Discrete Event Simulation model that attempted to estimate an individual patient’s length of stay (LOS) based on patient demographics, comorbidities and previous admission history, as well as the patient’s social care need.\nThe model experimented with various scenarios, including reducing placement times, and accelerated discharge for frail patients."

    "text": "This project was to be used to support a business case being prepared for reconfiguring beds on the Acute Stroke Unit in line with the Peer review recommendations\nA Discrete Event Simulation model was developed to represent the entire pathway. The model took into account four different cohorts of patients and based on historic activity data, applied Inter arrival time distributions to each cohort, branched patients proportionally through the various pathways and applied variable lengths of stay dependant on diagnosis and discharge destinations. The model included a range of parameters that could be modified between simulations to assess various scenarios and their impact on bed requirements.\nThe project also explored using modelling to improve the efficiency of the Cardiac Catheter Labs. The trust had two labs each running two scheduled 4 hour lists per day Mon-Fri, but for numerous reasons the lists were not being utilised efficiently with consequential impacts on both inpatient and elective time from referral to procedure. During 2017 this resulted in an average list duration of 208 minutes representing a 13% loss of capacity. If this lost capacity could be eliminated/reduced this would: • Reduce overall length of stay for emergency patients waiting for lab procedures which in turn will help with overall hospital flow. • Improve patient pathways • Tackle patient delay for elective diagnostics/interventions which is in line with core Trust Objectives.\nMeetings with the booking teams enabled the creation of a process flow diagram which highlighted a convoluted process from initial referral to eventual scheduling of procedures."

The model also found that adding a second Photo & Scan machine virtually eliminated queues for this part of the pathway."

The team developed a proof of concept initially that demonstrated they could use this type of analysis to identify “at risk” individuals in a matter of hours compared to over many months using traditional manual methods. The methods were then applied to identify a highly connected network of youths causing issues in a community within a Devon city.\nFiona Bohan, Performance and Analysis Manager at Devon and Cornwall Police, had this to say about the work :\n“The need for Social Network Analysis is clear. Criminal and exploitative networks are a huge and costly issue for police, their partner agencies, and the community. SNA, using minimal resource, can identify children at current and future risk of exploitation, as well as those key players within the network who pose the greatest risk. By targeting and removing these key players, and concentrating limited early intervention resources on protecting those at risk in the future, there are potential significant savings both in terms of child harm and partnership spend. This proof of concept has highlighted the significant benefits of embedding this approach in force and, in my view, will play an important part in policing in the future.”"

Exeter and surrounding areas have high housing targets and predict further growth as well as significant growth in an ageing population.\nThis project aims\n\nTo develop a demonstrator forecasting tool (using breast services as an example) which is made available through a StreamLit app to predict referrals and service demand.\nTo use this tool to demonstrate the impact of specific housing developments on service demand to inform workforce planning and to provide data to justify s106 payments from developers to support NHS infrastructure expansion.\nTo predict changes in geographical demand and thus feed into project in understanding optimum locations for services on the 10-20 year timescale.\n\nThe project objectives are\n\nTo look at the growth in referrals for breast services and predict future clinic capacity required to meet 2WW targets.\nTo separate the increase in referrals due to population growth from that due to changes in demographics and referral patterns (due to patient education and increasing incidence of cancer).\nTo create a model of growth based on assumptions about population growth and changes in demographics to obtain best and worst case scenarios in terms of demand."

    "text": "Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases and deaths worldwide. Despite numerous public health campaigns and interventions, smoking cessation remains a significant challenge. Understanding the factors that contribute to successful smoking cessation can help in designing more effective interventions.\nCertain pathways may suit individuals needs differently and thus have different likelihoods of success. This model will help to show which demographics and pathways are most effective at achieving a successful quit.\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies individuals likely to stop smoking based on their demographics and/or behaviours. Additionally, the project aims to uncover key predictors that can possibly influence smoking cessation, providing insights into the traits and behaviours that contribute to quitting smoking and which pathways offer better results for people.\nSeveral machine learning algorithms will be considered, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Each algorithm will be evaluated for its predictive accuracy and interpretability.\nDepending on the complexity of the data to be used, we will also consider employing ensembled methods to leverage the power of different models on one dataset."

    "text": "The Medium-Term Activity Projections (MTAP) model produces a set of baseline activity and price-weighted contact projections to 2040/41 for NHS England for some types of activity. As part of the MTAP project, we want to provide insight into the cost pressure based on this projected activity. Modelling the absolute cost is not possible, so one widely used approach to modelling cost pressure is using cost or price ‘weights’ for distinct and specific activity types. Changes in the ratios of different activity types are captured by the sum of the weighted activity.\nHealthcare Resource Group (HRG) codes are used in the NHS to categorise types of inpatient activity by assigning one of around 3,000 5-digit codes. The first 4 digits indicate the primary treatment or reason for care, e.g. primary hip replacement, and the 5th digit capturing complexity and comorbidities through the recording of secondary diagnoses. However, in recent years there has been a huge increase in the recording of secondary diagnoses with the introduction of Electronic Patient Records (EPR), but there is a hypothesis that this change does not represent a real increase in patient co-morbidity, and ‘coding creep’ is present.\nTo deal with this, National Cost Collection (previously known as Reference Costs) data is used to look at the relationship over time between the proportion of activity in each complexity category (the 5th character of the HRG) and the change in the average relative cost of each HRG. The hypothesis is that if increases in the proportion of more complex patients are real, then this should not lead to a reduction in the average relative cost of those HRG.\nThis research project proposes to identify whether the key factors influencing the complexity and comorbidity categorisation (CCC) have changed over time by:\n\nTraining a classification model to predict CCCs, using secondary diagnoses in the patient records as input features. The model will be trained on data for a given year, e.g. 2016/17, and the model performance for other time periods (e.g. 2022/23) will be compared. A significant change in performance may indicate that the factors influencing CCC have changed. If the 2016/17 performance gradually decreases over time as the use of EPR have been increasing, it could support the coding drift hypothesis.\nUsing explainable AI methods to identify the key factors driving classification in two time periods to assess if there has been a significant change.\nUse classification modelling approach to identify the key factors driving the prediction of HRG CCC and actual costs using National Cost Collection data over a given time period. If the HRG codes are reflective of reality, features should have similar relative importance in each model."

A second project used geospatial visualisation (QGIS) to assess community outpatient clinic demand, finding increasing waiting lists and poor clinic utilisation, leading to improved patient booking into Peripheral Sites.\n\n                \n\n            \n              \n                  \n                    \n                    \n              \n              \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Machine Learning\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                        \n                            \n                        \n                            \n                        \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                Modelling the effect of complex discharge delays on acute performance\n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n            \n              Hospitals face increasing A&E wait times, ambulance delays, and growing waiting lists, partly due to inefficient patient discharges.

    "text": "A Clinical Decision Unit (CDU) is a designated area for Emergency Department (ED) patients who require testing, treatment, and observational medical management for up to 12hrs. Only patients that meet well-defined criteria where there is an expectation that the patient should be able to safely return home and avoid hospital inpatient admission should be transferred to a CDU. The ED at the Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust (RD&E) is one of the only departments in England seeing over 100,000 patients a year without a CDU. This project sought to identify the optimum size and impact of a potential CDU.\nThe method To understand the patient journey through the department, a pathway map was first produced with the assistance of a multi-disciplinary ED team. In order to understand trends and variation in patient demand, length of stay and potential CDU appropriateness; detailed analysis of anonymised data recorded on the Trust ED system was undertaken. The ED clinical and managerial team determined that the criteria for CDU inclusion. A model of the ED pathway was built in Simul8 incorporating the CDU clinical acceptance model and actual data from the whole of 2016.\nThe results With a CDU open 24hrs a day 7 days a week, 99.9% of the time 4 cubicles would be adequate. In a year, just under 2% of attendances would be appropriate to route to the CDU which would have an impact of improving RD&E performance against the 4hr standard by +1.7%. These results will be integrated into the ED capital programme business case going to the RD&E Board in June 2017."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The research question for Devon Partnership NHS Trust was ‘How would Devon Partnership NHS Trust need to change its Urgent Care Pathway in order to reduce pressure in the system and send no patients out of county for care.’ Process mapping was undertaken to understand the system and 3 years of anonymous patient level information (from October 2013 to September 2016) was collected on the care pathway, from referral to discharge.\nA simulation model was developed and a number of scenarios were tested to assess the impact on the system of changes in demand for beds, lengths of stay and delayed discharge, and the number of inpatient beds in the system.\nThere were a number of key findings, which are described later in this paper, including : • There is a pressure in the mental health urgent care system, equivalent to 47 beds. This pressure is managed by purchasing out of area beds and also by running the urgent care system above desired capacity. This means that wards routinely run at above 100% occupancy ; place of safety and extra care areas are used to hold patients whilst waiting for a bed ; leave beds can be backfilled and crisis house beds are spot purchased in some localities. • Both the out of area spend and the extent to which the existing capacity is running ‘hot’ needs to be addressed to reduce the pressure in the system. This will enhance care for patients and the workforce. • There is no one solution and a reduction in demand, lengths of stay (including delayed discharge) combined with an increase in the number of beds is required. • There are not enough beds in the system. • DPT inpatient wards have relatively high occupancy levels, often above 100%, and low lengths of stay. This provides high throughput per bed compared to alternatives, such as step down or out of area beds. As a consequence closing any DPT beds could result in a higher cost alternative."

Variation in discharge rates across the seven-day week impact on the availability of inpatient beds both at the weekend and the start of the working week; typically weekends and Mondays are the worst performing days for discharge (see chart A) – this creates operational issues each week and has a negative impact on access to services and key operational performance standards.\nMethod • Initial stakeholder mapping and analysis • Creation of project teams for Complex Discharges and Weekend Discharges • Process mapping of multiple discharge pathways for simple and complex discharges • Analysis of critical steps to discharge including key delays and process step timings • Modelling of discharge pathways using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) software\nResults The modelling process of identifying discharge pathways, key staff groups required, delays to process steps and the communication flow through the discharge process both during the week and at the weekend was very beneficial to identifying improvements in the discharge process. Whilst the overall process was very complicated to model using DES, identifying which bottlenecks were evident and visualising the entire process was very valuable.\nImpact The changes made as a result of the modelling process and through the strategy groups formed to implement changes have seen positive results; this has contributed to increased discharges at the weekends and improved communication flows through the discharge process which has had a very positive effect on the whole discharge process especially for complex patients."

The team learned to combine geospatial analysis, demographic data, and travel distance calculations to create a dynamic tool for use by NHS service providers.\nThey will continue developing this tool, adding data sources that collaborating service providers hold, but are unable to publish alongside the open-source code, to better identify underserved groups with specific ailments to be treated. This will allow them to give more precise information to let their new service allocation tool pick more appropriate potential locations for new sites. They will be presenting the final model and app to stakeholders and getting feedback, adapting if required; then putting it on GitHub to be shared."

Through this and the ICP (Integrated Care Partnership) integrated care strategy supporting early intervention and prevention approaches, reducing the variation in how well people are supported with long-term conditions. This in turn reduces excess mortality.\nThe aim of the project was to understand and build on the definition of excess mortality and how the baseline is measured. Identifying periods of unexpected mortality (increases and decreases) to understand factors which may be driving changes.\nThe team learnt that the discrepancies of measuring expected mortality through five year rolling averages removes the impact of seasonality on mortality resulting in hidden trends; with seasonality patterns varying across different underlying causes. The output of the project will allow for differing definitions of expected mortality, providing a base line and forecast moving forward. In addition, different cohorts of the population are considered in line with the Public Health objectives and priorities.\nThe team are hoping to further develop their StreamLit app to make sharing and access available to the wider team – building questions and bringing in wider subject matter expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n“HSMA was an invaluable opportunity, I was impressed by how much the three members of the team learnt and the development of advanced analytics and forecasting.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hospitals across the country are struggling to provide patients with the care they need in a timely manner. Increasing waiting times in A&E departments, long waits for ambulances and growing waiting lists are all examples of these issues. A possible cause of these issues is the difficulty in discharging patients from acute hospital beds efficiently, due to lack of onward care capacity. Timely discharges are crucial to patient care, to get the right care in the right place at the right time.\nA previous PenCHORD project, IPACS, looked at understanding the capacity required in social and community care to facilitate timely flow out of acute hospitals. This project was based on IPACS, and extended the scope to include elective inpatient waiting lists and patients in the emergency department.\nThe aim of the project was to model flow of patients into and out of an acute hospital site, with particular focus on how delays to complex discharges affect patients waiting to come into the hospital. The results from this project will help to articulate how the issues in discharging patients from an acute hospital bed affect emergency care performance (time spent in A&E and ambulance handover time) as well as waiting lists for elective inpatient care. A discrete event simulation was created to model patient flow through an acute facility and into community/social care."

    "text": "The project aim was to develop a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model based on Colorectal Cancer pathway at Gloucester Royal Hospital to identify the key delays within the pathway and identifying feasible solutions.\nThe team met with cancer service leads to discuss the scope of the project and discussed the patient pathway in detail. Three years of anonymised patient records were used to create the model. Delays for the pathway were split into patient & provider delays to focus only on provider delays.\nThey used SimPy to create a DES model using the current colorectal patient pathway. They ran the simulation for 100 runs to get the average waiting time for each stage of the pathway to identify the stages that took the longest amount of time. The DES model showed us the key delay, which is diagnostic delays caused during investigative stages.\nThe findings from the analysis will be presented to cancer leads to support reducing the waiting times for colorectal patients. The DES model helped to evidence key bottlenecks of the patient pathway and will help to discuss the prospect of how increased resource can help improve patient outcomes."

For the purpose of their model they obtained detailed geographic offence data uploaded by police forces in England and Wales.\nThe model was able to take a crime indicator (e.g. violent and sexual offences) for a region in the UK, prepare the data, apply and compare map classification schemes and run various analysis techniques to identify spatial autocorrelation, LISA , identify hotspots, coldspots and outliers. The statistical output provided a level of confidence in the findings that they can incorporate into intelligence confidence reporting levels.\nThe model will be shared with Commodity Threat Leads with the intention of using it internally to identify spatial trends in datasets that are restricted. Applying spatial analysis to these datasets will help identify regional variation and help quantify visual observations that will provide statistical certainty to any observed visual findings. The model will be proposed and applied to more restricted crime data in order to be used to draw out useful visualisations and insights to feed into intelligence reporting."

    "text": "The aim of the project is to find out what role Patient Initiated Follow-up (PIFU) can play in the redeployment of capacity to address the backlog. This will be done by mapping outpatient pathways for rheumatology sub-pathway using discrete event simulation (DES).\nThe team did what-if modelling of resource use based on the proportion of patients on a PIFU pathway, the rate of PIFU patient-initiated requests and the use of advice & guidance. They used this to understand how released resource is redeployed, and how the upstream referral-to-treatment (RTT) waiting list behaves (size and waiting time to first outpatient).\nThe focus was on rheumatology as a case study since it had well documented pathways and good clinical evidence base on PIFU, with PIFU actively endorsed by NHSE and GIRFT. It is mainly an outpatient specialty with many chronic patients on long-term follow-up, meaning that the effect of PIFU is in theory amplified.\nOther opportunities include discussing a spin-off model that includes effect of other digital musculoskeletal peri-treatment interventions or creating a proof-of-concept generalised DES that can be used for other PIFU specialties (PIFU is being advocated across most elective specialties).\nOn the PIFU rheumatology model itself, the team aim to continue refining the model based on internal stakeholder feedback. A secondary aim is to create an end-user toy tool that could help demonstrate some of the what-if scenarios to operational managers, in collaboration with NHSE Digital Care Model colleagues."

The analysis identified a particular gap in the accessibility of cardiac surgery for patients in the Kent & Medway area, where there would be a significant benefit for the local population in the provision of a new cardiac surgery site or sites. The methods used gave a quantified and visual view of the impact of the options, and indicated the optimal configurations with 1 or 2 additional sites.\nThe team created a Streamlit application which allows a user to select from a list of possible new sites, and see the impact on travel times for Kent & Medway patients using maps, charts and a number of key travel time metrics.\nThe South East Cardiac Network have reviewed the findings, and this work will form part of the evidence base for service planning in the region. More generally, there has been interest in applying the methods and tools to other services."

    "text": "The project aim was to develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of admission and to provide explanatory feedback as to why the patients were at risk. There were three elements of the project:\n\nUsing structured data to generate a predictive model\nUse unstructured data from patient notes to generate a predictive model\nTo combine the two models to create an enhanced model\n\nThree models were developed using structured data – logistic regression, random forest and neural network. Logistic regression performed best.\nFor the unstructured data, attempts to use more advanced Natural Language Processing techniques (such as neural networks and transformers) were unsuccessful due to limited computing power. However, a more basic model using a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency matrix with a random forest showed some improvement on accuracy.\nElectronic health record data can accurately be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of non-elective admission. Administrative events are often better indicators than clinical measures, however EHR data is prone to several limitations and biases which can lead to counter-intuitive correlations. For analysis of unstructured data, greater computing power than I have access to is required to analyse the large quantities of patient notes, even when focusing on relatively short time frames.\nIt will make a difference to patient care by allowing patients at risk of non-elective admission to receive preventative care, leading to better health outcomes for the individual patients and freeing up inpatient resources for other patients."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of the project was to examine in more detail the question of whether booked appointment times might reduce waiting times in Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC). This was done by considering a “generic” UTC – a kind of average over services of this type which were submitting high quality data to the Emergency Care Dataset.\nData on the paths patients took through these services, how frequently patients arrived and the number of staff present were taken from this data and used to build a Discrete Event Simulation model. The modelled average time taken for initial assessment of the patient, treatment, and any investigations or tests was chosen to give the best fit to actual waiting times. The distribution of patient arrival times was then modified to simulate the introduction of additional booked appointments, leading to a more even spread of patient arrivals throughout the day.\nThe model showed a decrease in overall waiting times when higher percentages of patients booked a timeslot in advance. This will be used to better inform policy on the number of booked appointments needed to make a significant impact to waiting times. Further analysis is expected to shed light on the impact of different ways of prioritising patients according to both clinical need and whether they have booked in advance.\nThis is a great test case for the use of Discrete Event Simulation to inform policy and strategy at a national level. It demonstrates the impact that such modelling can have and creates opportunity for similar work in the future, ensuring that decision making is supported by high quality analytical insight."

This allows them to see patterns and suggest improvements, such as when it would be better for extra staffing. The web-page produces a “Forecast” demonstrating the attendances by hour/day/month/year as well as length of stay via interactive buttons. It is then able to give an estimate for a selected time to predict future demand.\nThey have completed the forecasting methods for this project and are now developing the machine learning model. The team hope to gain permission for this to be used on a wider scale so individual trusts can input their own data."

An initial neural network with very little optimisation matches the Logistic Regression performance, with the potential to beat it when other features are included.\nThe model needs to take other features, particularly more patient history, into account to improve performance and be extended to predict length of stay as well as admission."

    "text": "Operational Research and Data Science approaches – such as Machine Learning – can play a vital role in supporting the delivery of health, social care and policing services. Increasingly, such skills are proving to be important components of the analytical function of organisations in these sectors.\nIn 2016, NIHR PenARC launched the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme - an innovative and now entirely online training and mentoring programme in which staff working in health, social care and policing organisations are released for a day a week for a year to work on a modelling, simulation or data science project that addresses an issue of importance for their organisation.\nHSMA projects have led to\n\n£multi-million investments in mental health and urgent care services\nthe establishment of brand new modelling and Data Science roles within NHS organisations\nsupport for the COVID-19 mass vaccination programme\nsignificant career progression for the analysts involved\n\nThe programme was recently hailed as a flagship national example of the capacity building work of the NIHR Applied Research Collaborations.\nRead more about some of the stories of our past and present HSMAs."

Increasingly, such skills are proving to be important components of the analytical function of organisations in these sectors.\nIn 2016, NIHR PenARC launched the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme - an innovative and now entirely online training and mentoring programme in which staff working in health, social care and policing organisations are released for a day a week for a year to work on a modelling, simulation or data science project that addresses an issue of importance for their organisation.\nHSMA projects have led to\n\n£multi-million investments in mental health and urgent care services\nthe establishment of brand new modelling and Data Science roles within NHS organisations\nsupport for the COVID-19 mass vaccination programme\nsignificant career progression for the analysts involved\n\nThe programme was recently hailed as a flagship national example of the capacity building work of the NIHR Applied Research Collaborations.\nRead more about some of the stories of our past and present HSMAs."

    "text": "How does it work?\nThe best introduction to our programme can be found in the following video from our most recent open day.\n\nHowever, to summarise:\nThe HSMA Programme is split into two phases.\nIn Phase 1 (6 months), participants are taught a huge range of skills in Operational Research and Data Science via live online lectures and group exercises, including:\n\nProgramming in Python and R (no prior knowledge of programming required)\nDiscrete Event Simulation to model pathway and queuing problems\nSystem Dynamics to model whole systems\nGeographic Modelling and Visualisation methods to model location issues\nAgent Based Simulation to model behaviour\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, such as Machine Learning to teach machines to make decisions, and Natural Language Processing to extract information from free text data\nFree and Open Source Software (FOSS) development methods and tools\n\nAt any point during the programme a HSMA can register a project. By registering a project, the HSMA will receive a dedicated Slack channel that can be used to develop the project proposal, invite collaborators from the HSMA community, post updates of progress and ask for support. Phase 2 (9 months), will allow current HSMAs to undertake their Inception Project - first modelling or data science project - with access to a community of experts and regular drop in sessions for support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will only be able to register and support projects that are related to the modelling and data science areas taught within the HSMA programme and are in the areas of health, social care and policing."

Machine learning is here to save the day! While we don't have a book here, what we do have is a collection of the guided code examples from across the machine learning module of HSMA. These notebooks talk through the how and why of each step, as well as giving you a huge library of code snippets to use when building your own machine learning projects.\n\nThis book takes you through the key concepts in machine learning before we take a tour through a series of powerful supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and boosted trees - covering both the conceptual basis for each of these, and how to write Python code with the sklearn package to make use of them with your own data and evaluate how well they're performing. We also take a look at neural networks with tensorflow package.\n\nTo round this set of notebooks off, we take a dive into how you can calibrate and optimise your models, as well as taking a look at what's going on under the hood with explainable techniques like PDP, ICE and SHAP plots.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                          \n                           Free eBook \n                            \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n\n              \n                The HSMA Book of Streamlit\n            \n\n            \n              It's all well and good having an amazing bit of Python code - but how can you go about sharing that with the people in your organisation who don't use Python? In this book, we introduce the fantastic Streamlit package - a beginner-friendly web development framework that will have you creating interactive data apps in minutes, not weeks.\n\nCovering everything from 'Hello Streamlit!' to deploying your app on a free web hosting service, this book is great for beginners to the world of web development.\n\nFor the more seasoned Streamlit user, you will find a handy reference guide for a range of techniques, including multi-page apps, adding download buttons, partial reruns, custom styling, caching, session state, the stlite framework for browser-based code execution, and more.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                          \n                           Free eBook \n                            \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n          \n\n\nNo matching items"

We explore how to train a neural network that can identify whether a piece of text is positve or negative in tone, providing an insight into a flexible class of machine learning that can be used for other text classification tasks.\n\nThis year, the module ended with a 6 hour hackathon in which students were able to work in their peer support groups on a natural language processing task of their choice. While there is no taught content for this session, the presentations given by the groups of their projects from the day are available to watch.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                   Details \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n\n              \n                Module 6: Modelling Behaviour and System Dynamics\n            \n\n            \n              12 hours\n            \n\n            \n              In module 6, we explore two more techniques for modelling pathways and systems.\n\nWe kick off with system dynamics - a powerful tool for qualitative or quantitative (numeric) simulations of systems at a high level. System Dynamics excels at unpicking fundamental issues with the structure of systems. This session is codeless, using the online InsightMaker platform instead.\n\nWe then move onto agent-based simulation (ABS) - a simulation technique that is well-suited to instances where we are interested in the emergent behaviour of systems that comes from the interactions of and decisions of individuals. Commonly used in disease spread modelling, we explore how to write our own simulations using the MESA package, as well as digging into its possible applications in a more general healthcare context.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                   Details \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n\n              \n                Module 7: Open Source Collaborative Development and Web Development\n            \n\n            \n              18 hours\n            \n\n            \n              In this module we start by taking a look at a crucial skill for the analyst, data science or operational researcher's toolbox - version control with Git. Git ensures that the full history of your code is available, allowing you to\n• roll back to earlier versions of code\n• keep a clean working copy of code safe and accessible while being able to start working on new features\n\nSay goodbye to V2, V3_FINAL, and V_ACTUAL_FINAL_VERSION - with Git, you will always know where you are.\n\nWe then explore the online platform GitHub, which allows for hosting of code folders that are controlled using Git. GitHub is possibly the most used code-sharing and collaboration platform in the world, and is a crucial part of ensuring your code is available for others to audit, use and build on.\n\nWe then move on to creating web interfaces. With the advent of a range of tools that are designed to make it easier for people to create data-driven web apps and interactive model interfaces without having to learn the intricacies of traditional web development, it's a great time to start developing your own interfaces to get your scripts into the hands of others - without them having to install or use the code directly.\n\nIn this module, we'll be working with the Streamlit framework - a beginner-friendly but powerful Python library that will get your writing your first interactive apps in minutes.\n\nWe will cover\n• creating simple apps\n•  adding interactive elements like sliders, text and numeric inputs, dropdowns, and more\n•  adding outputs such as dataframes, interactive plots, and maps\n•  theming your app\n•  using layout elements such as tabs, columns, expanders, sidebars, and multi-page navigation\n•  improving the running of your app with advanced features like caching, fragments and sessin state\n\nWe will round off the module by practicing our Git and GitHub skills, uploading our apps to a GitHub repository so we can then host them on the Streamlit Community Cloud platform.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                   Details \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n\n              \n                Module 8: Modern Analytics\n            \n\n            \n              12 hours\n            \n\n            \n              This module serves to introduce some additional techniques that are useful parts of the modern analyst's skillset.\n\nWe start with a session on reproducible reporting, exploring how we can create beautiful html, pdf and Word reports with the Quarto library. Quarto allows for code - and the output of code - to be interweaved with text, headings, images, videos, and much more. We explore standard document layouts as well as dashboard-style layouts, and cover a range of useful Quarto parameters and tips.\n\nWith Quarto, we also look at automation and parameterisation of reports, exploring how to generate multiple reports just by running a simple Python script.\n\nIn the final session of HSMA 6, we take a look at time-series forecasting methods. These methods take historical patterns and use them to predict the future. The session covers a range of time-series forecasting approaches, as well as the circumstances under which you may consider using them and how to assess their performance.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                   Details \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n          \n\n\nNo matching items"

We then explore how to record results from our simulation and explore the impact of changing the level of resources available or the distribution of inter-arrival times and activity durations.\n\nThis content is also covered in part 2 of the HSMA little book of DES.\n\nThis session makes use of the des environment\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Open in Github Codespaces \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Exercise Solution Video - Part 1 \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Exercise Solution Video - Part 2 \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n\n              \n                2C: SimPy for Discrete Event Simulation - Part 2 3 hours\n              \n\n            \n              \n                Session Lead: Dr Daniel Chalk\n              \n            \n\n            \n              In this session, we look at some more advanced DES concepts and how we can incorporate them in our SimPy models.\n\nThis includes\n• warm up periods\n• priority-based queuing\n• resource unavailability\n• Lognormal distributions\n• reneging\n• balking\n• jockeying\n\nThis content is also covered in part 3 of the HSMA little book of DES.\n\nThis session makes use of the des environment\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Open in Github Codespaces \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n          \n\n\nNo matching items"

We then visualise both point and choropleth data using a combination of geopandas and the matplotlib library, enhancing our maps and exploring how we can use features of Python like loops or faceted maps to produce multiple maps from a dataset in a quick and reproducible manner.\n\n This session makes use of the geographic environment\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Bonus Slides - Inset Maps in Python \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video - Choropleths and print layouts in QGIS \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video - Geopandas and plotting static maps in Python with matplotlib \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n\n              \n                3C: Interactive Maps in Python with folium, visualising  travel time data in Python, and obtaining travel time data with routingpy 3 hours\n              \n\n            \n              \n                Session Lead: Sammi Rosser\n              \n            \n\n            \n              In this session, we take a look at creating interactive point and choropleth maps in Python using the folium package.\n\nWe also take a look at how we would visualise travel time data with a choropleth, and how we can use the routingpy Python package to pull travel time data for our own combinations of source and destination points at scale for free.\n\n This session makes use of the geographic environment\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Bonus Slides - Isochrones \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video - Interactive Maps in Python with Folium \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video - Visualising Travel Time Data in Python \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Video - Using routingpy to Obtain Travel Time Data in Python \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                    \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n\n              \n                3D: Location Allocation Problems 3 hours\n              \n\n            \n              \n                Session Lead: Sammi Rosser\n              \n            \n\n            \n              In this session we talk about how you would tackle a problem where you need to most efficiently place a certain number of sites to minimise the travel time, population-weighted travel time, or distance for a population across a region.

We also discuss when time series forecasting methods are a good fit for your problems, and when you should consider turning to other approaches.\n\nThis session has not yet been fully rewritten for HSMA 6.\n\nHowever, you can watch the sessions from HSMA 5, which cover the same material.\n\nSome bonus videos from previous rounds of HSMA are also linked below.\n\nDue to some troublesome environment issues, the exercises are not currently completely functional.
