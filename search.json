Of the datasets used the age distribution of an area was the most consistently predictive feature encountered.\nOne avenue for progression with this project is the creation of synthetic data to have each person within an area as a row of data.

Other feature sets could be explored such as the emergency admissions, type of planned admissions and other variable synthesised from the HES APC dataset."

    "text": "This project hopes to empower NHS service providers with a tool that grants a deeper understanding of the population they serve and allows them to direct future service expansion to provide access to underserved groups.\nIt will provide a nuanced demographic breakdown of the patient population, including age, ethnicity, and deprivation, offering crucial insights into the diversity of healthcare needs within the service area – with potential additions to allow providers to add new demographic information to better understand catchment by the conditions they look to treat.\nUndertaking this project gave us a deeper understanding of health modelling methodologies and their practical applications. The team learned to combine geospatial analysis, demographic data, and travel distance calculations to create a dynamic tool for use by NHS service providers.\nThey will continue developing this tool, adding data sources that collaborating service providers hold, but are unable to publish alongside the open-source code, to better identify underserved groups with specific ailments to be treated. This will allow them to give more precise information to let their new service allocation tool pick more appropriate potential locations for new sites. They will be presenting the final model and app to stakeholders and getting feedback, adapting if required; then putting it on GitHub to be shared."

This was accomplished and realised as an interactive webapp using Streamlit.\nThe project is FOSS and is available for anyone to use in the future to model their own surgical pathways or other waiting lists. Future HSMA participants, and anyone else who is interested, will be able to modify this model into a format useful to their organisation.\nThis will provide possible opportunities for the optimisation of surgical pathways, and also provide a ready-made format for future HSMA participants to create interactive SimPy-based webapps without having to “reinvent the wheel.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hospitals across the country are struggling to provide patients with the care they need in a timely manner. Increasing waiting times in A&E departments, long waits for ambulances and growing waiting lists are all examples of these issues. A possible cause of these issues is the difficulty in discharging patients from acute hospital beds efficiently, due to lack of onward care capacity. Timely discharges are crucial to patient care, to get the right care in the right place at the right time.\nA previous PenCHORD project, IPACS, looked at understanding the capacity required in social and community care to facilitate timely flow out of acute hospitals. This project was based on IPACS, and extended the scope to include elective inpatient waiting lists and patients in the emergency department.\nThe aim of the project was to model flow of patients into and out of an acute hospital site, with particular focus on how delays to complex discharges affect patients waiting to come into the hospital. The results from this project will help to articulate how the issues in discharging patients from an acute hospital bed affect emergency care performance (time spent in A&E and ambulance handover time) as well as waiting lists for elective inpatient care. A discrete event simulation was created to model patient flow through an acute facility and into community/social care."

created, along with an interactive tool allowing parameters such as the staffing levels to be changed. This allowed staff to explore the optimum levels of resourcing, enabling risk-free testing of staffing and resource changes before committing to these changes in the real-world.\n\n

employment. This was turned into a dashboard for internal use. However, it was concluded that the currently available data only acccounted for 13% of the variation in turnover seen; more data on other factors is required to explain the patterns seen.\n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Plotly Dash\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Regression\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Machine Learning\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS England\n                \n                • Yorkshire Ambulance Service\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                            \n                       Code \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                \n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Discrete Event Simulation\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • Dorset Intelligence and Insight Service (NHS Dorset)\n                \n                • BCP Council\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                \n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Streamlit\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Mapping\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Travel Times\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU\n                \n                • Wessex AHSN\n                \n                • Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n\nNo matching items"

parameters such as the staffing levels to be changed. This allowed staff to explore the optimum levels of resourcing, enabling risk-free testing of staffing and resource changes before committing to these changes in the real-world.\n\n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Discrete Event Simulation\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Streamlit\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • Royal Devon University Healthcare (RDUH) NHS Foundation Trust\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                            \n                       Code \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                \n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Network Analysis\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Plotly Dash\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS England\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Code \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "The aim of the project was to employ geographical and statistical analysis of past and present travel times to understand the impact the flow of activity into London has on travel times for patients, whether referral pathways could be changed to minimise patient travel, and the extent to which additional sites would have a beneficial impact.\nInitial analysis was undertaken on a sample of cardiac procedures within the hospital spell level data. The analysis identified a particular gap in the accessibility of cardiac surgery for patients in the Kent & Medway area, where there would be a significant benefit for the local population in the provision of a new cardiac surgery site or sites. The methods used gave a quantified and visual view of the impact of the options, and indicated the optimal configurations with 1 or 2 additional sites.\nThe team created a Streamlit application which allows a user to select from a list of possible new sites, and see the impact on travel times for Kent & Medway patients using maps, charts and a number of key travel time metrics.\nThe South East Cardiac Network have reviewed the findings, and this work will form part of the evidence base for service planning in the region. More generally, there has been interest in applying the methods and tools to other services."

We wanted to know what change needed to take place in order to keep on top of ongoing demand levels and see patients within an acceptable time - what do we need to do to maintain a steady state and avoid a backlog from developing?\nIn addition to maintaining a steady state, we wanted to understand how to eliminate the backlog that has developed as a result of the ongoing demand not being met.\nThe main bottlenecks were identified and the issue is not at the beginning of the pathway (getting the completed questionnaires back from parents/schools) like it has been suggested at the start of the project, but further down the pathway due to clinical staffing capacity. Furthermore, the developed model shows that recruiting just one extra clinician would result in having a steady state with the backlog not growing. The model also shows possible staffing requirements to remove existing backlog in 1-5 years in addition to keeping a steady state.\nThe findings and the model demo have been presented to the stakeholders including service managers, clinical and operational leads, service heads and the Trust board, and discussions on plans for how the model is used to support any improvement work in the service is already taking place."

    "text": "The aim of the project was to see if the occurrence of violent incidents on hospital wards could be reduced, if incidents could be pre-empted and interventions could be taken to try to prevent them from happening.\nThe trust has a wealth of electronic information about service users, staff, incidents, and what happens on inpatient units. The plan was to combine this information into a dataset and use machine learning techniques to predict which of our wards were most likely to suffer from an incident the following day. A dashboard would highlight these wards to senior nursing staff, who could experiment with actions to reduce incidents.\nDiscussions with key staff helped to identify which features from our systems would be the most helpful in predicting incidents. A large dataset was constructed, and machine learning methods were used in an attempt to predict where incidents might happen. Unfortunately, the dataset did not prove to be informative enough to generate a working model – the predictions made were inaccurate and there was no way to apply them to the work environment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The aim of the project was to examine in more detail the question of whether booked appointment times might reduce waiting times in Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC). This was done by considering a “generic” UTC – a kind of average over services of this type which were submitting high quality data to the Emergency Care Dataset.\nData on the paths patients took through these services, how frequently patients arrived and the number of staff present were taken from this data and used to build a Discrete Event Simulation model. The modelled average time taken for initial assessment of the patient, treatment, and any investigations or tests was chosen to give the best fit to actual waiting times. The distribution of patient arrival times was then modified to simulate the introduction of additional booked appointments, leading to a more even spread of patient arrivals throughout the day.\nThe model showed a decrease in overall waiting times when higher percentages of patients booked a timeslot in advance. This will be used to better inform policy on the number of booked appointments needed to make a significant impact to waiting times. Further analysis is expected to shed light on the impact of different ways of prioritising patients according to both clinical need and whether they have booked in advance.\nThis is a great test case for the use of Discrete Event Simulation to inform policy and strategy at a national level. It demonstrates the impact that such modelling can have and creates opportunity for similar work in the future, ensuring that decision making is supported by high quality analytical insight."

    "text": "The primary aim of the project was to improve Urgent Treatment Care (UTC) performance by developing a model which would help the Emergency Department (ED) team with the allocation of staff and rooms to match patient flow. The team wanted to understand what further staff and resources would be required for any variations in patient attendance. The ED team wanted to understand how changes in the patient pathway would reduce bottlenecks, for example, what would be the impact of front-loading diagnostics.\nInitially, a discrete event simulation model was developed to show how patients currently flow through UTC. After an initial model had been developed, it was used to test the proposed alternative pathways for diagnostics. It was also used to model different numbers of staff and rooms. The model made it easy to understand the impact of changes to the existing provision and what would be most cost-effective.\nThe ED department was redesigned based on the model findings, which identified a need for additional rooms leading to reconfiguration of the space. It started a review of staffing rotas to see how they could be better aligned to findings from the analysis and future staffing rotas are designed to align with what the model identified was needed to meet the 95% target."

    "text": "The aim of the project was to use available Primary and Secondary Care patient history and demographic information to better predict the chance of admission for respiratory conditions and subsequent length of stay, in order to better target interventions.\nDue to time and data constraints, the modelling is currently at an early stage, but has demonstrated some interesting preliminary findings and put the structure in place for further development.\nA Logistic Regression confirmed some expected factors but also revealed some surprises. An initial neural network with very little optimisation matches the Logistic Regression performance, with the potential to beat it when other features are included.\nThe model needs to take other features, particularly more patient history, into account to improve performance and be extended to predict length of stay as well as admission."

Three years of anonymised patient records were used to create the model. Delays for the pathway were split into patient & provider delays to focus only on provider delays.\nThey used SimPy to create a DES model using the current colorectal patient pathway. They ran the simulation for 100 runs to get the average waiting time for each stage of the pathway to identify the stages that took the longest amount of time. The DES model showed us the key delay, which is diagnostic delays caused during investigative stages.\nThe findings from the analysis will be presented to cancer leads to support reducing the waiting times for colorectal patients. The DES model helped to evidence key bottlenecks of the patient pathway and will help to discuss the prospect of how increased resource can help improve patient outcomes."

          \n              In this project, a computer simulation of the acute medical pathway in a Devon trust was created, along with an interactive tool allowing parameters such as the staffing levels to be changed. This allowed staff to explore the optimum levels of resourcing, enabling risk-free testing of staffing and resource changes before committing to these changes in the real-world.\n\n

          \n              In this project, a computer simulation of the acute medical pathway in a Devon trust was created, along with an interactive tool allowing parameters such as the staffing levels to be changed. This allowed staff to explore the optimum levels of resourcing, enabling risk-free testing of staffing and resource changes before committing to these changes in the real-world.\n\n

factors such as employment. This was turned into a dashboard for internal use. However, it was concluded that the currently available data only acccounted for 13% of the variation in turnover seen; more data on other factors is required to explain the patterns seen.\n

    "title": "Developing a generic vaccination service model for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In winter 2020, vaccinations had recently been approved for use in the UK to protect people against the COVID-19 virus. Consequently, a mass vaccination programme was required to vaccinate most of the population of the country, which led to local GP surgeries having to pivot to deliver vaccinations for their communities at a scale and pace never seen before.\nThis project was led by a HSMA who had never undertaken any coding work before but using his training from the HSMA programme he rapidly developed a Discrete Event Simulation model of the proposed pathway and resourcing for a vaccination service in North Devon. The model was able to predict not only the rate at which patients could be vaccinated with proposed resourcing, but also the potential risks of social distancing breaches in the waiting room and overflowing in the carpark. The model identified potential issues with the proposed plans, and was used to refine the plans to enable a safe but efficient delivery of the vaccinations in North Devon.\nThe HSMA also worked with the South West Academic Health Science Network (AHSN) to develop a generic version of the model that could be used for any future vaccination services, and has made the model available Free and Open Source for anyone to use anywhere in the world:\nDr Kwiatkowski said: “I enjoyed designing it. It predicts queue lengths, car park capacity and times for every step of the vaccination process in the clinic to avoid overcrowded waiting rooms. In the winter of 2020/1 the country was back in lock down and there seemed no end in sight regarding COVID. The vaccines seemed like a ray of hope and setting up the clinics was instrumental in turning the tide. Being able to use the knowledge gained from the HSMA course to help design the process was fantastic. The clinic has now delivered over 100,000 vaccines.”"

We then explore how to record results from our simulation and explore the impact of changing the level of resources available or the distribution of inter-arrival times and activity durations.\n\nThis content is also covered in part 2 of the HSMA little book of DES.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Video \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                        \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n\n              \n                2C: SimPy for Discrete Event Simulation - Part 2 3 hours\n              \n\n            \n              \n                Session Lead: Dr Daniel Chalk\n              \n            \n\n            \n              In this session, we look at some more advanced DES concepts and how we can incorporate them in our SimPy models.\n\nThis includes\n• warm up periods\n• priority-based queuing\n• resource unavailability\n• Lognormal distributions\n• reneging\n• balking\n• jockeying\n\nThis content is also covered in part 3 of the HSMA little book of DES.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                        \n                          \n                     Slides \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Video \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Repository \n                        \n                    \n                          \n                     Book \n                        \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n          \n\n\nNo matching items"

Machine learning is here to save the day! While we don't have a book here, what we do have is a collection of the guided code examples from across the machine learning module of HSMA. These notebooks talk through the how and why of each step, as well as giving you a huge library of code snippets to use when building your own machine learning projects.\n\nThis book takes you through the key concepts in machine learning before we take a tour through a series of powerful supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and boosted trees - covering both the conceptual basis for each of these, and how to write Python code with the sklearn package to make use of them with your own data and evaluate how well they're performing. We also take a look at neural networks with tensorflow package.\n\nTo round this set of notebooks off, we take a dive into how you can calibrate and optimise your models, as well as taking a look at what's going on under the hood with explainable techniques like PDP, ICE and SHAP plots.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                          \n                           Free eBook \n                            \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n    \n          \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n\n              \n                The HSMA Book of Streamlit\n            \n\n            \n              It's all well and good having an amazing bit of Python code - but how can you go about sharing that with the people in your organisation who don't use Python? In this book, we introduce the fantastic Streamlit package - a beginner-friendly web development framework that will have you creating interactive data apps in minutes, not weeks.\n\nCovering everything from 'Hello Streamlit!' to deploying your app on a free web hosting service, this book is great for beginners to the world of web development.\n\nFor the more seasoned Streamlit user, you will find a handy reference guide for a range of techniques, including multi-page apps, adding download buttons, partial reruns, custom styling, caching, session state, the stlite framework for browser-based code execution, and more.\n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                \n                          \n                           Free eBook \n                            \n                \n\n              \n\n            \n          \n\n\nNo matching items"

By registering a project, the HSMA will receive a dedicated Slack channel that can be used to develop the project proposal, invite collaborators from the HSMA community, post updates of progress and ask for support. Phase 2 (9 months), will allow current HSMAs to undertake their Inception Project - first modelling or data science project - with access to a community of experts and regular drop in sessions for support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will only be able to register and support projects that are related to the modelling and data science areas taught within the HSMA programme and are in the areas of health, social care and policing."

    "text": "This project used Network Analysis methods to identify the social relationships between groups of people who could be causing significant issues within their communities, and enable the police to consider pro-active interventions to target those who may be at risk of future offending because of their social links with offenders. The team developed a proof of concept initially that demonstrated they could use this type of analysis to identify “at risk” individuals in a matter of hours compared to over many months using traditional manual methods. The methods were then applied to identify a highly connected network of youths causing issues in a community within a Devon city.\nFiona Bohan, Performance and Analysis Manager at Devon and Cornwall Police, had this to say about the work :\n“The need for Social Network Analysis is clear. Criminal and exploitative networks are a huge and costly issue for police, their partner agencies, and the community. SNA, using minimal resource, can identify children at current and future risk of exploitation, as well as those key players within the network who pose the greatest risk. By targeting and removing these key players, and concentrating limited early intervention resources on protecting those at risk in the future, there are potential significant savings both in terms of child harm and partnership spend. This proof of concept has highlighted the significant benefits of embedding this approach in force and, in my view, will play an important part in policing in the future.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The project aim was to develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of admission and to provide explanatory feedback as to why the patients were at risk. There were three elements of the project:\n\nUsing structured data to generate a predictive model\nUse unstructured data from patient notes to generate a predictive model\nTo combine the two models to create an enhanced model\n\nThree models were developed using structured data – logistic regression, random forest and neural network. Logistic regression performed best.\nFor the unstructured data, attempts to use more advanced Natural Language Processing techniques (such as neural networks and transformers) were unsuccessful due to limited computing power. However, a more basic model using a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency matrix with a random forest showed some improvement on accuracy.\nElectronic health record data can accurately be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of non-elective admission. Administrative events are often better indicators than clinical measures, however EHR data is prone to several limitations and biases which can lead to counter-intuitive correlations. For analysis of unstructured data, greater computing power than I have access to is required to analyse the large quantities of patient notes, even when focusing on relatively short time frames.\nIt will make a difference to patient care by allowing patients at risk of non-elective admission to receive preventative care, leading to better health outcomes for the individual patients and freeing up inpatient resources for other patients."

The other issue they had with getting the data was the limits imposed on the amount of data you could download in one go, meaning that it was a lengthy process.\nThey modelled potential update scenarios and have started to work on this and have making great progress. They will use the previous vaccination data, along with the Winter 2022 vaccination data to strengthen the tool, so that following vaccination seasons it can be used more widely. They will look at other vaccinations it could be applied to, such as flu.\nThis will give users an easy to use tool to keep track of vaccinations and pick up problem areas quickly. It will save time and money on current methods and enable more people to use and understand the vaccination position"

For the purpose of their model they obtained detailed geographic offence data uploaded by police forces in England and Wales.\nThe model was able to take a crime indicator (e.g. violent and sexual offences) for a region in the UK, prepare the data, apply and compare map classification schemes and run various analysis techniques to identify spatial autocorrelation, LISA , identify hotspots, coldspots and outliers. The statistical output provided a level of confidence in the findings that they can incorporate into intelligence confidence reporting levels.\nThe model will be shared with Commodity Threat Leads with the intention of using it internally to identify spatial trends in datasets that are restricted. Applying spatial analysis to these datasets will help identify regional variation and help quantify visual observations that will provide statistical certainty to any observed visual findings. The model will be proposed and applied to more restricted crime data in order to be used to draw out useful visualisations and insights to feed into intelligence reporting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nottingham University Hosptials has two major Acute Medicine Assessment areas (WB3 and AMRA), where patients can be reviewed before being sent to the most appropriate specialty base ward bed for their needs.\nWB3 and AMRA run at very high occupancy levels, and patients frequently wait in the Emergency Department (ED) for a WB3/AMRA bed for more than 6 hours – this is a known cause of delay-related harm. Stakeholders feel that a major constraint is patients waiting in WB3/AMRA who are ready to be moved to a ward bed.\nThe team wanted to investigate what the impact would be if patients were able to leave WB3/AMRA more quickly. What would this do to the backlog of queues in ED, and how would it affect waiting times there?\nA Discrete Event Simulation (DES) was made of the entire Acute Medicine assessment pathway. They then simulated several alternative scenarios in which patients leave WB3/AMRA more quickly after their period of assessment is completed – and were able to see the impact of this in the key metrics.\nIf all patients left WB3/AMRA within four hours of their request for a ward bed, patients would never have to wait in ED for a WB3/AMRA bed for more than 6 hours. Even if all patients left WB3/AMRA within 16 hours of their request, this would still reduce the number of patients waiting more than 6 hours by 90% - substantially reducing the risk of delay-related harm\nWe can now start to quantify the number of additional ward beds that would need to be freed up to support this improved flow, and bring these findings to discussions on how/where additional bed days could be released."

Understanding this would allow the team to examine trends and predict future demand so they better plan workforce.\nThey have designed a web-based app where they can input the Sheffield Children’s hospital data and use it to explore trends in attendances and length of stay. This allows them to see patterns and suggest improvements, such as when it would be better for extra staffing. The web-page produces a “Forecast” demonstrating the attendances by hour/day/month/year as well as length of stay via interactive buttons. It is then able to give an estimate for a selected time to predict future demand.\nThey have completed the forecasting methods for this project and are now developing the machine learning model. The team hope to gain permission for this to be used on a wider scale so individual trusts can input their own data."

The team wanted to see if changing the allocation of therapist resources by running an evening face-to-face clinic, instead of an evening group, would improve overall wait times for therapy.\nPatients were created as entities within the model, and average % preferences for IESO (online therapy), group therapy, virtual or face-to-face 1-1 appointments were assigned. Along with whether the patient was a priority, preferred evening or face-to-face appointments, and average number of appointments offered. They used current and historic data of people waiting or seen for therapy, attendance rates, and meeting with the data lead and service managers within Steps 2 Wellbeing, in order to gain an accurate picture of the waiting and treatment pathway for patients.\nThe model does confirm that the longest wait times appear to be for people waiting for face-to-face or evening 1-1 appointments. The model shows improvements in waiting times when an evening group is changed to a 1-1 face-to-face evening clinic.\nThe team is making changes to the model based on stakeholder feedback and will present to senior management within the service."

    "text": "The aim of the project is to find out what role Patient Initiated Follow-up (PIFU) can play in the redeployment of capacity to address the backlog. This will be done by mapping outpatient pathways for rheumatology sub-pathway using discrete event simulation (DES).\nThe team did what-if modelling of resource use based on the proportion of patients on a PIFU pathway, the rate of PIFU patient-initiated requests and the use of advice & guidance. They used this to understand how released resource is redeployed, and how the upstream referral-to-treatment (RTT) waiting list behaves (size and waiting time to first outpatient).\nThe focus was on rheumatology as a case study since it had well documented pathways and good clinical evidence base on PIFU, with PIFU actively endorsed by NHSE and GIRFT. It is mainly an outpatient specialty with many chronic patients on long-term follow-up, meaning that the effect of PIFU is in theory amplified.\nOther opportunities include discussing a spin-off model that includes effect of other digital musculoskeletal peri-treatment interventions or creating a proof-of-concept generalised DES that can be used for other PIFU specialties (PIFU is being advocated across most elective specialties).\nOn the PIFU rheumatology model itself, the team aim to continue refining the model based on internal stakeholder feedback. A secondary aim is to create an end-user toy tool that could help demonstrate some of the what-if scenarios to operational managers, in collaboration with NHSE Digital Care Model colleagues."

However, it was concluded that the currently available data only acccounted for 13% of the variation in turnover seen; more data on other factors is required to explain the patterns seen.\n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Plotly Dash\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Regression\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Machine Learning\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS England\n                \n                • Yorkshire Ambulance Service\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                            \n                       Code \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                A Discrete Event Simulation Model to reduce Rheumatology waiting times in Dorset\n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Discrete Event Simulation\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • Dorset Intelligence and Insight Service (NHS Dorset)\n                \n                • BCP Council\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                Developing a tool to assess inequalities and demographic coverage of service locations\n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Streamlit\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Mapping\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Travel Times\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU\n                \n                • Wessex AHSN\n                \n                • Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n\nNo matching items"

The aim of this project was to look at the relationship between the different investigations. Hamzah pulled data from the NHS ECDS and created a series of graphs based by A&E provider.\nThe aim of the project become to create a web tool that can provide insight in how diagnostic procedure are used in A&E departments across the country. Hamzah learnt a lot about graph analysis and the connection between clinical theory and analytical process.\nHamzah is now working on creating a web tool that allows users to explore the graphic visualisation as well as some analytics that accompany the graphs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since the amount of data being collected and stored has increased significantly, datasets are often reviewed manually, particularly when free text fields are present. This project focussed specifically on the detection of drug-related content, following the announcement of the Governments 10-year drugs plan in December 2021. If successful, this could then be adapted and applied to further crime types at a later date.\nThe aim was to create a model that would be able to make predictions on future datasets by classifying each piece of text into drug/non-drug related content, to prevent manual coding of the data. To achieve this, the team used a machine learning technique known as Natural Language Processing, to train various models on the structure of text and any patterns in language.\nThe team created a model pipeline to automate this process end-to-end. Initial findings suggesting these techniques could be rather successful, however, it has only been possible to test this on dummy data at present. If this were to be implemented as a permanent solution, this could potentially be made available to the wider policing community through the development of a Streamlit app, which could greatly assist in reducing the amount of data and time taken to review each dataset manually."

    "text": "The team’s project was to create a computer model of part of the acute medical pathway in their hospital trust. As part of this process patients come in with non-surgical emergencies, like an abnormal heart beat, and they’re triaged to decide the best route of care for them. In some cases that will be an admission to hospital, but increasingly this may involve alternatives that combine just a few hours in hospital with close follow up and perhaps even forms of remote monitoring, like monitoring their heart through a mobile app.\nThe aim of this project was to model part of the acute medical pathway in this hospital trust, simulate how the system currently works, and investigate whether there is optimal allocation of staff and resources. The benefit of this model is it allows for changing parameters such as adding extra staffing to see what impact that has on the pathway. Testing these changes in the real-world costs time and money, while computer simulation allows you to trial these changes with minimal cost and no risk.\nThe model isn’t validated yet, but when it is it’ll be handed over to users (e.g. clinicians and managers) to support them in making decisions about staffing or resourcing. They’ll be able to test those changes mentioned above without risk before proceeding to a real-world test of change.\n\nAccess the Github Repository"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Within the organisation (NHS England) forecasting for clock starts is currently done using scenario-based modelling in Excel. This limits how much data can be used to make forecasts, and the techniques that can be deployed. There was a desire to explore other forecasting methods to see if they could obtain more accurate forecasts, and also to valid the forecasts that are being made using the existing model. Understanding demand is important to manage wait lists, which is a high priority for the NHS, hence the interest in modelling clock starts.\nThe aim of the project was to explore different ways of forecasting demand, evaluate their performance and offer suggestions as to how forecasting could be done in the future.\nThe team carried out exploratory data analysis to understand differences between different data types and the differences in the patterns of demand for different subgroupings. They built a codebase that loaded the required data and ran model functions for Naïve, ARIMA, Prophet and a combination of Linear Regression and Random Forest. They evaluated the performance of these models to each other, and the modelling technique currently used. They also made some progress on rebuilding the current excel model in Python.\nThey found that while the more performant models that we used performed well (produced low error metrics), they generally didn’t perform as well as the model currently used within the organisation. This suggested that a helpful next step of the project might be to complete the work of translating the excel model into python and doing further work to understand if they can get more data to better understand the drivers of demand beyond just time series."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Community diagnostic centres (CDCs) have been launched across England to tackle the diagnostic backlog and address healthcare inequalities. CDCs and commissioners struggle to identify their baseline of healthcare inequalities and monitor their impact going forwards. This leads to resourcing constraints on teams in the short term and risks minimising the CDC’s impact on healthcare inequalities in the long term. As these are emerging services, the quality of data collected by them to understand their impact is unclear. This impact can be estimated through a health equity audit, however this is usually and long and manual process.\nThe aim of the project was to create an open source and shareable tool to:\n\nPerform a health equity audit to identify where the service may be having an impact on healthcare inequalities\nIdentify where data may be incomplete or poor quality, and automatically suggest evidence-based strategies to improve the data\n\nThis has been achieved through development of Python code to process data and a Streamlit app to present data. This project involved developing a toolkit to explore inequalities for multiple sites. Through trialling this toolkit with dummy data for different sites we have developed metrics would be most suitable to identify different regions.\nThe team would like to further develop the tool to make it more widely applicable and include more robust analysis of inequalities. They are planning to engage with local and national stakeholders of CDCs to demonstrate the tool and gather feedback. They are also planning to implement changes suggested by the Patient and Public Involvement Group (PenPEG).\nThe tool itself, at a minimum, will support a local CDC to understand their local impact on healthcare inequalities and address areas of concern where relevant. It’s an example to demonstrate the power of open-source techniques and data in healthcare inequalities. If adopted by multiple regions, it would allow different regions to generate similar outputs which would allow for easier comparison and sharing of learning. The code developed could also be easily adapted and reused for other healthcare services beyond CDCs."

Through this and the ICP (Integrated Care Partnership) integrated care strategy supporting early intervention and prevention approaches, reducing the variation in how well people are supported with long-term conditions. This in turn reduces excess mortality.\nThe aim of the project was to understand and build on the definition of excess mortality and how the baseline is measured. Identifying periods of unexpected mortality (increases and decreases) to understand factors which may be driving changes.\nThe team learnt that the discrepancies of measuring expected mortality through five year rolling averages removes the impact of seasonality on mortality resulting in hidden trends; with seasonality patterns varying across different underlying causes. The output of the project will allow for differing definitions of expected mortality, providing a base line and forecast moving forward. In addition, different cohorts of the population are considered in line with the Public Health objectives and priorities.\nThe team are hoping to further develop their StreamLit app to make sharing and access available to the wider team – building questions and bringing in wider subject matter expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n“HSMA was an invaluable opportunity, I was impressed by how much the three members of the team learnt and the development of advanced analytics and forecasting.

Anticoagulation is very effective in reducing stroke risk but can increase the risk of bleeding, a much feared consequence of anticoagulation is bleeding on the brain. National and international guidance states that anticoagulation should not be withheld because of falls as the benefits still outweigh the risks but many clinicians choose not to prescribe these medications to people who fall or those at risk of falls because they don’t believe the evidence supports this recommendation.\nThe initial stage aims of this project is to explore if machine learning techniques can be used to develop a model that can predict injurious falls in older people with AF and determine what features are important.\nThe longer term aim of this project is to ascertain whether a tool could be developed to personalise anticoagulant treatment based on falls risk to help clinicians and patients make more informed treatment decisions."

This means there is poor performance against all the key ED wait metrics for the hospital and more importantly, there is evidence that long waits for admission in ED are associated with poorer outcomes for patients.\nThe two main strategies employed to tackle this problem is increasing the number of beds (by creation of escalation beds) and trying to decrease discharge delays (reducing length of stay). Additionally, with Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) facility it is unclear how the number of people admitted through this facility impacts the waits of those in ED.\nGiven x beds, how far does admitted length of stay have to reduce to meet particular waiting time targets for those queuing in ED? (Evidence based target) If we open 15 beds but keep admitted length of stay the same, what is the impact on ED waiting times and the various targets? (Evidence for a particular management strategy) What is the optimum number of people to stream from ED to SDEC to minimise ED waits?

biggest drivers of staff turnover using regression modelling on staff workforce figures as well as other local factors such as employment. This was turned into a dashboard for internal use. However, it was concluded that the currently available data only acccounted for 13% of the variation in turnover seen; more data on other factors is required to explain the patterns seen.\n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Plotly Dash\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Regression\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Machine Learning\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS England\n                \n                • Yorkshire Ambulance Service\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                            \n                       Code \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                \n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Discrete Event Simulation\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • Dorset Intelligence and Insight Service (NHS Dorset)\n                \n                • BCP Council\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n      \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n                \n            \n\n            \n              \n                Complete\n              \n            \n\n             \n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                  \n                      Streamlit\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Mapping\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                      Travel Times\n                    \n                  \n            \n            \n\n            \n              \n                \n                • NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU\n                \n                • Wessex AHSN\n                \n                • Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust\n                \n              \n            \n\n          \n\n            \n               Details \n                    \n                      \n                          \n                            \n                       Video \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                    \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n\nNo matching items"
