The HSMA Programme is accredited by the Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts (AphA) and all participants are able to cite this as part of their participation. However, we also recognise that some participants may want to receive a digital certificate to confirm their completion of the programme. To this end, we provide optional certification via Accredible.

To ensure that we are only certifying those that have adequately engaged with the course, if a participant would like to be certified, we require some evidence that a participant has both

a)  undertaken and sufficiently engaged with the training provided as part of the programme, and
b)  is able to apply at least some of the skills taught.

For participants in HSMA 6, we have provided two options for those who wish to receive a certificate.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Participants may either

-   Provide their HSMA project work as evidence *or*
-   Undertake the HSMA 6 Assessment
:::

It should be noted that participants only need to choose ONE of these options if they want certification, and there is no difference in certification between the two options. Participants can only be certified once.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
It is also important to note that the certification does not represent a formal academic award, simply a ‘stamp’ of completion of the HSMA programme.
:::

## Option 1: Provide their HSMA project work as evidence

Students may choose to provide their HSMA project work as evidence of their engagement and ability to apply the skills taught.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
This is the recommended option for most participants, as it provides us with a more accurate picture of a participant’s ability to use the skills taught in practice over time, and does not require the participant to undertake a separate piece of work under examination conditions.

### Is my project 'ready'?

It's important to remember that, for accreditation, your project does not have to be

- complete
- in active use in your organisation

(although we will be absolutely delighted if either of those are the case!)

Remember that we are looking simply for evidence that you have **undertaken and sufficiently engaged with the training provided as part of the programme**, and are **able to apply at least some of the skills taught.**

We're not looking for perfect code, a world-changing
:::


The key steps in the process are:

- [ ] Ensure your project is registered as an official HSMA project (if you have a project channel on the HSMA Slack, it is!)
- [ ] Make your code available in a GitHub repository
- [ ] Fill in the [project reporting form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=d10qkZj77k6vMhM02PBKUyRMB0tNJCJMhcBInCaOXtxUN0hPWlkwSVo2T0NUSkM5RUdRNzBSVVBLSy4u&route=shorturl)
- [ ] Post a message on your project Slack Channel

A sample message is provided below, which you can copy into Slack and amend with your links.

```
*Project Submission Request*

Hi @Dan Chalk (Programme Lead) and @Sammi Rosser  { HSMA Trainer }

This project is ready to be submitted for accreditation, covering the following people:
[FILL IN NAMES OF PEOPLE IN PROEJCT TEAM]

Project Github Link: [PROVIDE GITHUB LINK]

I confirm that the project reporting form has been filled in.
```

The programme staff will acknowledge receipt of your request, and let you know when a decision has been reached on accreditation.


### Detailed Requirements

To submit project work as certification evidence, the following guidelines must be met.

#### The project must be an officially registered HSMA project (registered on the HSMA Project Register)

This ensures that the project is one that uses the skills taught on the programme, and has an application area in health, social care or policing.

If your project is not already registered, you can follow the instructions on [this page](registering_a_project.qmd#registering-your-project).

#### The evidence must be submitted as a link to a GitHub repository

Ideally, this GitHub repository will contain the code, commit histories and relevant documentation for the project.

If your organisation uses a similar alternative, such as BitBucket or GitLab, this will also be accepted.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
While most HSMA projects will be code-based, some projects may instead use QGIS or InsightMaker.

We would recommend that these projects still make use of GitHub, and discussions should be had with the programme staff if it is not going to be possible to make use of GitHub.

-   Projects using InsightMaker can export the .InsightMaker file and track changes to this on Github.
-   QGIS project files can also be uploaded to a GitHub repository. It is recommended that students install the [qgis_trackable_project_files](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis_trackable_project_files) and use the .qgs format.

### Help! My organisation won't let me upload the code to GitHub (Click to expand)

If you are having trouble getting your code shared with us, there are a few things you can try.

#### Remember - you don't have to (and generally won't) share the data!

Organisations are often concerned about what will go into the GitHub repository. Letting them know that it's only the code that will be shared

We don't need to be able to run the code to provide accreditation - though it's great it we, and the wider community of people who may wish to reuse your code, can.

Consider whether you might want to provide a dummy dataset intead, which doesn't necessarily have to replicate the patterns seen in your real data as long as the structure/data types are the same as the real data.
Packages like [faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) can help with this.


#### Explore sharing the code as a private repository

If your organisation is more comfortable with the code only being visible to the programme staff, then you can set it up as a 'private' repository.

You can then add Dan and Sammi as **collaborators** on the repository, giving them access.

![](assets/2025-07-29-11-48-11.png)

You will need to add both Dan Chalk and Sammi Rosser. The easiest way to find them is to use their Github usernames:

```
hsma-chief-elf
```

```
Bergam0t
```

#### I can't install Git locally on my machine

If this is the case, you may still be able to share the code on GitHub via manual uploads:

Take a look at this guidance from GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository

While this is not ideal as it means we will not be able to see

#### My organisation are completely blocking the use of GitHub and will not budge on the matter

Contact Dan and Sammi on Slack and we can explore alternative routes for you to provide the code.

:::


#### Authorship of code and other materials should be made clear

This is particularly important for projects involving multiple HSMAs, so that each HSMA involved can provide a case for their certification.

The optimal way for this to be evidenced is via the Git/GitHub commit history, which would ideally show who has authored what in the code and documentation.

Where this is not possible to provide, a written statement from all HSMAs involved in the project can be provided, detailing the areas of contribution to the project from each HSMA. Please contact programme staff for more details about this.

#### The Post-project form must be filled in and submitted

**Each member** of the project group who wishes to be accredited must fill in the [project reporting form (also referred to as the 'HSMA Bite')](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=d10qkZj77k6vMhM02PBKUyRMB0tNJCJMhcBInCaOXtxUN0hPWlkwSVo2T0NUSkM5RUdRNzBSVVBLSy4u&route=shorturl).

Members of a project group may provide the same information for the 'HSMA Project' section (questions 12, 13 and 14) as each other where reasonable to do so.

### What happens after the project is submitted?

On submission, HSMA Programme staff will look over the work provided.

-   They will determine whether the work demonstrates that the author(s) have sufficiently understood the techniques adopted, and have produced good quality code.
    -   If so, certification will be provided.
    -   If not, staff will contact the HSMA(s) involved in the first instance to explore
        -  if there is further evidence that they can provide, or
        - advise them to resubmit at a later stage when the project has advanced further, or
        - if neither of these are possible, to direct them to undertake a subsequent assessment (if such an assessment is planned by the programme staff) if they still wish to be certified.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
The decision of programme staff is final, but extensive discussion will take place for any proposed rejections of evidence before any such decision is taken to ensure that the decision is fair.
:::


## Option 2: Undertake the HSMA 6 Assessment

**If participants are not undertaking a HSMA project, or would prefer to receive certification sooner, they can choose to undertake the HSMA 6 Assessment**

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
The assessment will take place on 28th January 2025 at 1000 - 1200.

Students should join this session using the normal HSMA Zoom Link.
:::

-   Participants who wish to undertake the assessment must undertake the assessment live **unless there are extenuating circumstances (which must be discussed with the programme staff ahead of time)**. Participants will have 90 minutes from the start of the assessment to submit their solutions. Instructions for how to do this, and how the assessment will be released, will be provided in an introductory 30 minute session on the day.

-   There is no plan to provide an alternative assessment on a different date.

-   HSMAs can choose to undertake an assessment for a future round should they fail or not choose or be able to take the HSMA 6 assessment. Details of future assessments will be shared with the community on Slack. However, we cannot at any point ‘guarantee’ future rounds (and therefore future assessments) as the HSMA programme is dependent on fixed term funding. Alternatively, students who fail or are unable to take the assessment can instead opt to go down the project-based assessment route.

-   Participants are required to have a working, local installation of Python, along with the ability to work with Jupyter Notebooks, to undertake the assessment. Some questions will benefit from the HSMA having access to prior environments set up during the training phase to test solutions, though code can still be written and submitted without this.

-   The assessment is “open book” - therefore, HSMAs are welcome to refer to any notes they choose to help them answer the questions. However, plagiarism is strictly prohibited, and this includes using an AI tool to write the code for you. HSMA programme staff and others HSMAs also cannot be used to ask for help during the assessment.

-   The assessment consists of three “core” questions which test basic Python skills, and a series of additional questions, from which HSMAs should choose any two to answer. These additional questions are based on the various modelling and data science approaches taught in Phase 1.

-   The assessment is supplied as a Jupyter Notebook. Each question in the assessment asks the HSMA to write some code in the corresponding code cell to achieve a task. Typically, some code will already be present in the code cell, and the HSMA must simply add code to the cell where indicated.

-   Each question is worth a set number of marks (with all non-core questions awarding equal marks). If the code written by the HSMA works and does what is asked, then full marks for the question are awarded. If not, marks are awarded at the marker’s discretion depending on how close to a working solution they were. The HSMA Programme staff will mark the assessments.

-   To pass the assessment and receive certification, a HSMA must achieve at least 50% of the available marks. There is no distinction in certification for marks awarded above this.

-   The decision of the markers is final. However, all potential “fail” cases will be moderated by both markers to ensure that the decision is fair and consistent with other marks awarded.

-   All marked submissions will be returned to participants so they can see how they scored.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The assessment will be released afterwards so that anyone can use it as practice or revision material, though it will not be possible to complete it at that point to gain accreditation.
