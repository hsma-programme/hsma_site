Quarto site for the HSMA program.

Project will automatically rerender on upload - does not rely on local rendering of files with one important exception - see below.

Note that the script previous_projects/generate_by_site_yml.qmd must be run locally at present.

It has not been incorporated into the automatic rendering of the site on commit at present.
