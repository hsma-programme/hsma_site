## Our Materials

Recordings of the course, as well as all of our course materials, are offered **free of charge** to anyone, anywhere in the world, for personal use and adaptation.

Head over to our [books](hsma_content/books/books.qmd) or our [HSMA 6 content recordings](hsma_content/modules/modules.qmd) to work through this year's course at your own pace - for free!

## Our Projects

While HSMA involves a large training element, the main focus of the programme is to support participants to undertake their own projects in their organisations.

On the website you can find more out about our [projects that are currently in progress](previous_projects/projects_in_progress.qmd) or [projects that have previously been undertaken](previous_projects/completed_projects.qmd).

You can also view projects [by method](previous_projects/projects_by_methods.qmd), [by area of application](previous_projects/projects_by_service_area.qmd), [by HSMA cohort](previous_projects/projects_by_cohort.qmd) or [by service](previous_projects/projects_by_organisation.qmd).
