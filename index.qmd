Welcome to the website of the Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme.

HSMA is a course teaching **data science** and **operational research** techniques to participants from across healthcare, policing, social care and other public sector services in England.

Starting from learning the basics of Python and progressing through simulation modelling, machine learning, website development and more, participants are empowered to enhance the use of data within their organisations.

We are currently in the middle of round 6 of the HSMA programme, supporting over 50 projects across various sectors.

The start date for round 7 of the programme has not yet been set, but if you are interested in being kept up to date with our plans via our mailing list, please [drop us an email](mailto:penchord@exeter.ac.uk?subject=Add%20Me%20to%20the%20HSMA%20Mailing%20List%2C%20Please!&body=Please%20add%20me%20to%20the%20HSMA%20mailing%20list.%0A%0A**This%20is%20an%20automatically%20generated%20email%20from%20a%20link%20on%20the%20HSMA%20website**).

## Our Materials

Recordings of the course, as well as all of our course materials, are offered **free of charge** to anyone, anywhere in the world, for personal use and adaptation.

Head over to our [books](hsma_content/books/books.qmd) or our [HSMA 6 content recordings](hsma_content/modules/modules.qmd) to work through this year's course at your own pace - for free!

## Our Projects

While HSMA involves a large training element, the main focus of the programme is to support participants to undertake their own projects in their organisations.

On the website you can find more out about our [projects that are currently in progress](previous_projects/projects_in_progress.qmd) or [projects that have previously been undertaken](previous_projects/completed_projects.qmd).

You can also view projects [by method](previous_projects/projects_by_methods.qmd), [by area of application](previous_projects/projects_by_service_area.qmd), [by HSMA cohort](previous_projects/projects_by_cohort.qmd) or [by service](previous_projects/projects_by_organisation.qmd).
